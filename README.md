# SDC Innovation Management

## Main Teaching Reference
While this course does not come with a list of mandatory readings, we will often refer to some central resources in R and python, which for the most part can always be accessed in a free and updated online version.  We generally recommed you to use these amazing ressources for problem-solfing and further self-study on the topic.
