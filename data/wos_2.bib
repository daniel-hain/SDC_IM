Abstract = {{This paper takes an innovation system approach to analysing the
   development of wind energy in three jurisdictions: the EU, USA and

   studies on wind in two ways. First, it focuses on the interactions over

   highlight lessons for low-carbon policymaking. Second, it extends the
   analysis from the formative and growth phases of the innovation system
   to the globalisation and transfer phase, in which mature technologies
   are transferred to new markets. The conclusions are: first, policies
   should go beyond market pull' and technology push' and should take into
   account the institutional frameworks through which they are delivered;
   second, policies have been more successful where they prioritised
   long-term learning-oriented deployment rather than short-term
   efficiency; third, system failures exist at the transfer stage of
   development as well as during formative and growth phases.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{452-460}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the determinants of backward linkages from the oil
   and gas industry in Nigeria. Secondary and primary data collected cover
   firms engaging in fabrication and construction; well-construction and
   completion, and control systems and ICT. Both descriptive and
   inferential statistical approaches were employed in the paper. Despite
   the widespread view that local content in the Nigerian oil industry is
   very low, there is a clear evidence for the existence of linkages - at
   least insofar as the three sub-sectors considered in this analysis are
   concerned. The paper shows that many of the linkages in the Nigerian oil
   value chain involve local firms, and that this has been a consequence of
   local content policies and investments in telecommunications and
   transport. Linkages have been held back by weaknesses in power and water
   infrastructure. The large investment in higher education in Nigeria
   suggests that skill-constraints have not been a major obstacle to
   linkage development in the three sub-sectors. The flow of labour to and
   from other sectors is indicative of learning spillovers, both within
   Nigeria and in the West African regional economy. Regression analysis
   shows that skills, policies, the quality of the national innovation
   system and their interactions are the major drivers of backward
   linkages. A number of policy implications to enhance linkage development
   in Nigeria's oil and gas value chain are identified. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{111}},

Abstract = {{The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) involves a package of
   management practices for rice cultivation that was developed by a French
   Jesuit priest in Madagascar. Although the technical and economic
   efficacy of the package is heavily contested among rice scientists, the
   package has spread rapidly across the globe, at least in the sense that
   many rice farmers now identify them with the term `SRI'. Understanding
   the spreading process of SRI may yield important lessons for
   agricultural research and extension establishments which often have
   difficulty to spread their ideas and technologies. This paper seeks to
   throw some light on the spreading process of SRI within the context of
   Andhra Pradesh, India. Inspired by innovation theoretical
   considerations, we do not orient ourselves to the spread at the farmer
   level, but rather to the way in which SRI was adopted by higher level
   organisations and institutions. This paper suggests that the formation
   of a heterogeneous `support network' which transcends the conventional
   agricultural networks is likely to have played a significant role in the
   spreading of SRI. As part of this network, an important newspaper has
   reported disproportionally about SRI and represented it in a highly
   favourable manner. This simultaneously mirrors support for SRI among
   higher level actors in the agricultural innovation system, and is likely
   to have contributed to further awareness and opinion formation at this
   level. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the impact of integration of the Iranian Health
   Ministry and medical universities, which took place in 1985, on `linking
   research to action'.
   Study design: A qualitative study including 18 in-depth interviews and
   10 focus group discussions with different stakeholders ranging from
   researchers, policy makers and service providers in medical and
   non-medical groups.
   Methods: A thematic framework was used to identify various positive and
   negative aspects of the integration on `linking research to action' to
   date.
   Results: The positive influences on universities that have been
   established since integration and/or in the peripheral provinces are
   more prominent. Distribution of health manpower in various parts of the
   country has almost unanimously been stated as a positive aftermath. On
   the other hand, the negative influence most agreed upon was the
   deviation of larger universities from their main commitment of knowledge
   production, due to overindulgence in service delivery.
   Conclusions: Before making any decisions about changing the current
   structure of the health-research system, the country's national
   innovation system should be defined. This is because national research
   problems are not confined to integration and health research, and cover
   more general aspects. Therefore, any change in integration and health

   indicators give results that are consistent with mutual information,
   which shows that collaborations among the three national sectors (U, I,

   collaborate much more with foreign researchers. It is also shown that
   universities used to play the central role in the national publication

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECONOMIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{135-155}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the question of why making a catch-up is even more
   difficult in capital goods industries that are usually led by small or
   middle-sized companies. It relies upon the sectoral systems of
   innovation as a theoretical framework for analysis. From the findings,
   the paper has identified three sources of difficulties in the catch-up
   of the capital goods industry, particularly in machine tools.
   First, while small firms in the capital goods industry are usually
   specialized suppliers to big final goods assembly firms in the consumer
   goods industry or other industries, and thus the tacit knowledge
   accumulated from the interface between the producer and the customer
   firms is very important, a serious difficulty lies in the fact that
   local client firms are reluctant to use locally made capital goods due
   to their poor quality and low precision level. Second, while a
   successful catch-up first requires the ability to produce goods of
   better quality and lower prices than those produced by incumbent firms
   from advanced countries, a typical difficulty arises because incumbent
   foreign firms often react by charging predatory prices upon news of the
   local development of capital goods by latecomers. Third, if the catch-up
   firms overcome this barrier, then the next strategy used by incumbent
   firms is to charge latecomers with legal actions for patent violations.
   Despite these intrinsic difficulties, the Korean economy has achieved a
   very slow but gradual catch-up in the capital goods industry. The paper
   has attributed such achievement to several factors, including the
   strenuous efforts of the government, niche markets in general-purpose
   machine tools and emerging economies, and finally, the increasing
   introduction and adoption of information technology (IT) or digital
   technologies in machine tools.
   Furthermore, the three sources of barriers to catch-up imply that any
   latecomer firms that wish to record a successful catch-up should have
   these barriers in mind from the beginning of the road towards catch-up.
   We observe that a successful catch-up requires the ability to produce
   goods of better quality and lower prices than those produced by
   incumbent firms from advanced countries. After the initial success, they
   should also be well prepared against eventual or possible attacks by the
   incumbent firms in the forms of predatory pricing and intellectual
   property rights (IPR) charges.}},

   information technology have also evolved along with technological
   capability, thereby changing the focus of technological strategies and
   the role of public institutions. It is found that distinctive patterns
   of learning and diffusion mechanisms in the case of DRAMs, TDX, and CDMA
   systems represent successful catch-up situations in Korea as presented
   in this paper. This paper characterises the stylised facts of the Korean
   innovation system in the IT sector and traces how technology and
   institutions coevolved throughout the development process. The
   transition from technology-using to technology-generating is not an
   automatic process. Cumulative learning in both technology and
   organisation is a critical factor to upgrade technological capabilities.
   The main policy implication of the paper is that it is important to
   design the cot-responding organisational and institutional arrangement
   in accordance with the changing need of technological upgrading.}},

Abstract = {{Problems of action and structure underpin key issues in research on

Abstract = {{Few comprehensive and long time-span studies have examined the
   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector in China and its
   implications for China's national and regional innovation system. Taking
   advantage of the patents granted by the State Intellectual Property
   Office of the People's Republic of China from 1985 to 2010, this paper
   examined innovation performance in the Chinese ICT industry with the
   help of bibliometric techniques. The analysis has been conducted from
   several perspectives, including the trend and character of patent
   outputs, the most prolific Chinese regions and their changes, the
   primary innovators and their type of institutions, and the collaboration
   among university (U)-industry (I)-research institutes (R). The results
   show that the great importance that the government and domestic
   enterprises attach to technology R\&D and patent protection has brought
   significant improvements in the Chinese ICT sector, and enterprises have
   thus gradually become the main body of technological innovation in
   recent years. In terms of U-I-R collaborations, I-I collaborations are
   the most popular pattern, followed by U-I and I-R collaborations. In the
   last 20 years or so, U-I-R collaborations have improved, but they are
   still weak. In the future, U-I-R collaborations should be further

Abstract = {{Networks within an organization and also among organizations are

   Previous papers have shown that dense networks are closely related with

   and diverse connections with the others can open an opportunity for
   breakthrough. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the network
   structure of an industrial cluster and compare its results with that of
   a field study, and found that firms in the cluster do not regard it as
   dense, which means that there are opportunities even in the densest
   network. This is because it is not so easy to look for business partners
   beyond a company's current partnerships while tight communication exists
   among firms having partnerships. Therefore, we propose a system of
   finding a plausible business partner to span the current boundary and to

Abstract = {{The analysis of clusters has attracted considerable interest over the
   last few decades. The articulation of clusters into complex networks and
   systems of innovation-generally known as regional innovation
   systems-has, in particular, been associated with the delivery of greater
   innovation and growth. Despite the growing economic and policy relevance
   of clusters, little systematic research has been conducted into their
   association with other factors promoting innovation and economic growth.
   This article addresses this issue by looking at the relationship between
   innovation and economic growth in 152 regions of Europe during the
   period between 1995 and 2006. Using an econometric model with a static
   and a dynamic dimension, the results of the analysis highlight that (1)
   regional growth through innovation in Europe is fundamentally connected
   to the presence of an adequate socioeconomic environment and, in
   particular, to the existence of a well-trained and educated pool of
   workers; (2) the presence of clusters matters for regional growth but
   only in combination with a good social filter, and this association
   wanes in time; (3) more traditional research and development variables
   have a weak initial connection to economic development, but this
   connection increases over time and is, once again, contingent on the
   existence of adequate socioeconomic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{While over the past two centuries technological advance has enabled
   remarkable increases in worker productivity and the general standard of

   been little progress made in how we go about educating children. And
   today there are many challenges for humankind where new technology is
   much needed, but thus far has been hard to achieve; dealing with global
   warming is a prime example. This essay is concerned with identifying the
   reasons for the very uneven technological progress that has been made

   great need where progress to date has been very slight. The concept of

   long-term strategies for gaining a competitive advantage are now

   (MCDM) model based on a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) and
   a VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) is

   to provide Taiwanese airlines with innovation-oriented techniques for
   future strategy development. We believe that the AIS can contribute to
   the survival of Taiwanese airlines in the near future. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{321-331}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we use scale-independent indicators to explore the
   performance of the Chinese innovation system from an economic and from a
   science and technology point of view, and compare it with 21 other
   nations. Some important developments in the Chinese innovation system,
   hidden by rankings by conventional performance indicators, were
   revealed. We find that gross domestic expenditure on R\&D (GERD) \&
   gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP \& POP (population) all exhibit
   strong `Matthew effects', measured by their scaling factors. This means
   that the Chinese R\&D intensity (GERD/GDP) and national wealth (GDP per
   capita) are growing significantly with the increase of the GDP. Also
   pairs such as citations \& papers, papers \& GDP, citations \& GDP, and
   paper \& GERD exhibit these `Matthew effects'. This observation points
   to the fact that in China scientific outputs and impacts are growing
   faster than economic growth and research investment. However, according
   to another scale-independent indicator, namely the adjusted relative
   citation impact (ARCI), China ranks on the bottom of the list, but the
   growth rate of the ARCI is the highest among these countries (comparing
   the periods 1995-1999 and 2001-2005). To sum up, we interpret these
   findings to mean that the scientific outputs and impacts of China show a
   real tendency of catching up with its economic growth. It is expected
   that with an increase of its GDP and R\&D intensity China will show a
   sustained increase in indicators related to science and technology.
   Similarly, there are very strong `Matthew effects' between the outputs
   of technology (patents) and economic growth and research investment.
   This means that the outputs of technology are expected to increase
   considerably with an increase of GDP and R\&D expenditure. Furthermore,
   in the Chinese innovation system the government intramural expenditure
   on R\&D (GOVERD) has a stronger non-linear impact on patent productivity
   than business enterprise expenditure on R\&D (BERD). This shows that in
   China research institutions financed by the government play a more
   important role than enterprises. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{68}},

Pages = {{1481-1488}},

Abstract = {{Governments have invested heavily in the clinical and economic promise
   of health innovation and express increasing concern with the efficacy
   and efficiency of the health innovation system. in considering
   strategies for `better' health innovation, policy makers and researchers
   have taken a particular interest in the work of universities and related
   public research organizations: How do these organizations identify and
   transfer promising innovations to market, and do these efforts make best
   use of public sector investments? We conducted an ethnographic study of
   technology transfer offices (TTOs) in Ontario and British Columbia,
   Canada, to consider the place of health and health system imperatives in
   judgments of value in early-stage health innovation. Our analysis
   suggests that the valuation process is poorly specified as a set of
   task-specific judgments. Instead, we argue that technology transfer
   professionals are active participants in the construction of the
   innovation and assign value by `imagining' the end product in its
   `context of use'. Oriented as they are to the commercialization of
   health technology, TTOs understand users primarily as market players.
   The immediate users of TTOs' efforts are commercial partners (i.e.,
   licensees, investors) who are capable of translating current discoveries
   into future commodities. The ultimate end users - patients, clinicians,
   health systems - are the future consumers of the products to be sold.
   Attention to these proximate and more distal users in the valuation
   process is a complex and constitutive feature of the work of health
   technology transfer. At the same time, judgements about individual
   technologies are made in relation to a broader imperative through which
   TTOs seek to imagine and construct sustainable innovation systems.
   judgments of value are rendered sensible in relation to the logic of
   valuation for systems of innovation that, in turn, configure users of
   health innovation in systemic ways. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Under the National Innovation System (NIS) framework, knowledge stock

   proxied by patents and papers is different from that proxied by R\&D,

Abstract = {{Based on the post-independence industrialization experience of Algeria,
   this paper explores the need for and the challenges and prospects of

   policy in developing countries to ensure that the former played only a
   residual role, while the latter took the lead in providing for the
   development of a culture of innovation. The culture of bureaucracy and
   institutional fragmentation has been a major factor militating against
   initiatives for technological capability development; and the

Abstract = {{The data presented here were collected as one component of a project
   aimed at developing a regional innovation strategy for the West Midlands

   distinct regional innovation strategies may be developed in each
   assisted region is premised on a belief in underlying idiosyncrasies in
   regional resource endowments, competencies, institutional
   infrastructure, industry, and governance. In other words, it is premised
   on the belief that there exist, or may exist with sufficient
   encouragement or facilitation, distinct regional innovation systems

Abstract = {{The organisational and spatial embeddedness of innovator firms is often
   taken for granted. This paper develops a theoretical synthesis of
   regional science (milieu innovateur, systems of innovation) and
   organisation science (resource and activity-based perspective)
   accounting for the proximity effect (benefiting from localised ties).
   The resulting research models enable us to derive several hypotheses on
   factors influencing the organisational and spatial embeddedness of
   innovation networks. Results of OLS and logistic regression analyses,
   using an unique firm-level database of 689 manufacturing firms located
   in the Dutch region of Noord-Brabant, support most of the hypotheses.
   First, high levels of complexity of innovative activities induce
   organisational embeddedness. Second, spatial embeddedness of innovative
   ties with buyers/suppliers is influenced, in particular, by pre-existing
   economic ties of innovating firms and the need for frequent contacts.
   Findings are, however, sensitive because features of innovative
   activities differ depending on the position of the innovator firm (user
   or producer). Therefore, no general explanation of the proximity effect
   can be found. It turns out that the use of complementary theoretical
   perspectives is a fruitful way of researching the proximity effect

Abstract = {{The study tries to analyze regional technological capabilities, linking
   technological positions to economic strength of the region. To measure
   this link, we correlate the EPO patent data with trade data to assess
   the degree to which technological advantages are translated into
   comparative advantages for the Flemish region in Belgium. The analysis
   for Flanders provides some interesting insights. Following the skewed
   distribution of firms, the technological areas in which Flanders is able
   to build a strong position are very specific: printing technology,
   weaving technology, photography and recently also telecommunications.
   Weak positions are outspoken in car technology. Linking these strengths
   and weaknesses in technological areas to economic activity revealed an
   important mismatch between both. Most of the Flemish patents are in
   sectors without any comparative advantage, while most of the sectors
   where Flanders does hold a comparative advantage, like chemicals and
   pharmaceuticals, do not show strong technological advantages in terms of
   patents. Given the mismatch that was detected between technological
   positions and economic advantages, it is of crucial importance to better
   understand the (missing) links between the various actors in the
   regional innovation system. The analysis points out two important
   issues. The large and growing number of foreign applicants to
   Belgian/Flemish inventors and the large number of subsidiaries of
   foreign firms among Belgian/Flemish applicants illustrate the
   pervasiveness of the foreign dimension in the Belgian/Flemish
   technological landscape. Also very specific to the Belgian/Flemish

Abstract = {{Economic growth requires innovation that can only occur through

   central direction and explicit planning such as embodied in a National
   Systems of Innovation approach are inherently limiting because of an

   (NSE) approach, one that recognizes the uncertainty of the

   NSE-guided public policy can play in improving the entrepreneurial

Abstract = {{The innovation systems approach, which has taken a prominent position in
   the academic literature, has also influenced policy-makers around the
   globe. Most research analyses innovation systems taking a national,
   regional or sectoral perspective, following a `technological
   imperative'. Yet changes in institutional conditions and the importance
   of non-technological innovation question the accuracy and the relevance
   of the existing boundaries of innovation systems. These developments ask
   for a better understanding of how innovation systems integrate within
   and across different levels. Drawing on a novel combination of
   configurational and econometric analysis, we analyse 384 Swiss firms and
   identify five co-existing innovation systems: two generic innovation
   systems, the autarkic and the knowledge-internalisation; one regional
   innovation system, the protected hierarchy; and two sectoral innovation
   systems, the public sciences and the organised learning. The generic
   innovation systems entail the `Science, Technology and Innovation' (STI)
   and the `Doing, Interacting and Using' (DUI) learning modes. These
   systems are structurally distinct and do not integrate. In contrast, all
   regional and sectoral innovation systems integrate the learning modes of
   the generic innovation systems and complement them with idiosyncratic
   elements. The perspective on co-existing innovation systems that we
   develop here indicates the existence of two layers of innovation
   systems: a `central' layer that hosts generic innovation systems and
   that constitutes the foundation for a second `surface' layer that hosts
   regional and sectoral innovation systems. We discuss the implications of
   layers of co-existing innovation systems for policy-makers and future

Abstract = {{In this paper we ask what is the place of institutional entrepreneurship
   in a (regional) innovation system. The main research questions addressed
   are (a) how does a new science-based concentration of innovation become
   institutionalized in an innovation system; (b) who are the institutional
   entrepreneurs and what do they actually do in their efforts to
   institutionalize new beliefs, practices, and activities within a system;
   and (c) what knowledge do institutional entrepreneurs need and what kind
   of power do they exercise in the institutionalization process. We add
   new knowledge to studies focusing on innovation systems by revealing how
   new elements are attached into it. We also add power and knowledge to
   the study of institutional entrepreneurship and institutional change.
   The empirical analysis identifies the main phases of
   institutionalization, key actors in different phases, and their
   strategies of influence. This paper is based on the analysis of
   secondary data and twenty-eight interviews with key actors.}},

Abstract = {{Policymakers as well as corporate managers want to know how to gain the
   lead and benefit from a paradigmatic shift in technology. This paper
   develops and uses a combined policy and firm-level theoretical framework
   to derive policy implications from a case study of the development of
   battery, hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs, HEVs and FCVs) in
   Japan. Among the implications of the study, it is argued that Japanese
   national policy has so far had a limited direct role in the
   electrification of vehicles; this has been very largely decided and
   carried out in-house at the automakers. Policymakers need to consider
   this as well as the inherently international nature of the automotive
   industry. One key factor behind Toyota's and Honda's early and sustained
   lead in the electrification trajectory is the intense and in some
   aspects quite specific type of competition on the domestic market, which
   has nurtured firms with a strong product development capability.
   Finally, it is argued that the proposed theoretical framework
   contributes to a more balanced view of the role of policy in this
   potential paradigmatic shift in technology in a mature industry,
   compared to traditional policy or firm-level approaches. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper examines the incidence of innovation and the configuration of

   Thus, the emergent actor-constructed regional innovation system
   stretched well beyond the confines of Cumbria. This configuration can be
   explained, in large part, by considering entrepreneurial origin. New
   arrivals (especially immigrants) demonstrated the greatest propensity to
   innovate, using innovation systems which cut across the regional and

   demonstrated a low incidence of innovation. The paper concludes that a

Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{501-514}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how research on
   knowledge-based economy (KBE) has increased noticeably in recent years.
   However, while some literature is available on construct model and
   validity analysis, little information is available on causal model.
   Design/methodology/approach - This work used the Knowledge Assessment
   Scorecards of World Bank, applying the linear structural relation model
   to address the causal model of knowledge-based economy.
   Findings - The results found that an open innovation system was the key
   to the knowledge-based economy competitiveness, and the effective
   information technology and excellent human resources were over the
   economic environment.
   Research limitations/implications - This work is a cross sectional
   analysis that considers the causality between different KBE endowments.
   However, focusing on specific group by longitudinal analysis should be
   further considered. Moreover, this work addresses the causality between
   different KBE endowments; however, the proposed model did not compare
   the differences between the different countries, regions, and
   socioeconomics.
   Practical implications - This work suggests that every country should
   construct an open national innovations system, and that not only focuses
   on the participated public and private sectors but also expands to
   relative economic structure, regime, and various social cooperation
   networks that help effectively improve collective learning and knowledge
   innovation.
   Originality/value - This work used the 2005 KAS comprising a set of 80
   structural and qualitative variables that benchmark how an economy
   compares with its neighbors, competitors, or countries. The comparison
   is undertaken for a group of 132 countries that include almost all of
   OECD economies and about 90 developing countries. Moreover, this work
   used the path analysis with observed variables (PA-OV) model under the
   LISREL to address the causality between different KBE endowments.
   Overall, this work proposed some important conclusions and suggestions.}},

   projects}},
Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Stakeholder involvement in research processes is widely seen as
   essential to enhance the applicability of research. A common conclusion
   in the extensive body of literature on participatory and
   transdisciplinary research is the importance of the institutional
   context for understanding the dynamics and effectiveness of
   participatory projects. The role of institutional context has become
   increasingly important in view of large international research projects
   implementing shared participatory methodologies across countries (for
   example within Horizon 2020 and within CGIAR programmes), which each
   have different institutional contexts. Despite the generally accepted
   importance of the institutional context for understanding the unfolding
   of participatory and transdisciplinary research projects, surprisingly
   little research has actually looked into its role in greater detail.
   This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by studying how a set
   of participatory principles and methods in a European project on
   integrated pest management (denoted as co-innovation in the project
   under study) was applied by researchers and advisers operating in a
   single international research project under the institutional conditions
   of four countries. The principal finding of this study is that, although
   constraints and enablers of participatory research at the personal level
   (e.g. researcher identity) were similar across the studied countries,
   research organisation- and community-based constraints and enablers
   differed, as well as those at the level of the overall innovation
   system. The institutions at different levels interact and create
   country-specific histories and path-dependencies, which lead to
   different degrees of propensity and preparedness, and hence different
   starting positions for participatory approaches. Consequently, when
   participatory research methods and approaches are applied in different
   contexts following a one-size-fits-all approach they may be less
   effective if not translated to institutional conditions at different
   levels. The study suggests that large international participatory
   research projects make provision in their design for careful selection
   of project team individuals, the composition of teams, and pay attention
   to the room for manoeuvre that the project, institute and national
   contexts provide for participatory research. To support the adjustment
   of participatory approaches to local institutional conditions, large
   international projects would benefit from fostering learning spaces that
   enable reflection on translation to local contexts and are capable of
   connecting to a wider network of decision makers and influencers that
   can facilitate institutional change in organisations and innovation
   systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has become increasingly clear that a transition to low-carbon energy
   systems, including a widespread diffusion of renewable energy
   technologies (RETs), is necessary for the world to handle the challenges
   of climate change. Previous innovation system oriented research has
   identified barriers to development and early-stage diffusion of RETs,
   but more research is needed to understand what kind of institutional
   frameworks and governance tools are needed to achieve effective
   large-scale diffusion at a stage when technologies are commercially
   available and new demand-side actors become involved. The purpose of
   this paper is, therefore, to identify the main challenges faced by
   adopters of renewable electricity technologies under different
   institutional frameworks as well as their strategies for overcoming
   them. Results based on a qualitative multiple case study of 28 adopters
   in France and in Sweden show that adopters were faced with system-level
   challenges, such as market-structure obstacles and lack of institutional
   routines, as well as actor-level challenges, such as lack of resources
   or behavioral characteristics. The study also highlights the difference
   between blocking and restraining challenges and proposes that barriers
   are better thought of as challenges that can be overcome. It shows the
   importance for policy makers to consider not only system-level diffusion
   challenges, but also to understand actor level contexts, including the
   behaviors of adopters who contribute to the transition. A further
   understanding how new entrants have managed to overcome existing
   challenges may provide new policy tools to facilitate the adoption for
   new adopters, for instance by encouraging the use of networks or by
   supplying specific information to potential adopters who lack it. (C)

Abstract = {{The need for domestic smallholder farming systems to better support food
   and nutrition security in the Caribbean is a pressing challenge. The
   Caribbean Community (CARICOM) faces complex socio-ecological challenges
   related to historical legacies of plantation agriculture, small
   population sizes, geographic isolation, jurisdictional diversity, and
   proneness to natural disasters, all of which underscore the importance
   of fostering system-wide innovation potential. This paper explores the
   factors that are impacting the innovation potential of smallholder
   farming households in four CARICOM small island developing states (St.
   Lucia, St. Kitts-Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana) using data
   collected through producer household surveys, focus groups, and key
   informant interviews. Results indicate that a systemic lack of access to
   finance, markets, and knowledge networks is perceived as limiting
   smallholder innovation potential in the region. Compounding these
   challenges was a pervasive lack of trust reported between actors and
   institutions throughout the agricultural innovation system, hindering
   the potential for collective action. Our findings point to the need for
   more decentralized governance approaches that are capable of
   establishing stronger relationships between actors and institutions to
   enhance knowledge flows in support of regional rural development and
   food and nutrition security objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Technological diversity is important to achieve long-term technological
   progress as diversity fosters recombinant innovation and renders
   undesirable lock-ins less likely, Many government policies influence the
   diversity of a technology, in particular by subsidizing collaborative
   innovation projects. This study investigates the influence of network
   position and the composition of innovation projects on the creation
   diversity of an emerging technology at a system level. We first
   conceptualize technological diversity and formulate hypotheses using a
   combination of innovation system and social network arguments.
   Empirically, we study the Dutch innovation system in relation to biogas
   energy technology.
   Our results show that the more projects are related to each other
   through shared actors, the less likely they are to contribute to
   technological diversity. This supports the arguments that diffusion of
   knowledge and sharing knowledge bases lead to less diversity. With
   regard to composition, we found that including more partners in a
   project is negatively related to diversity, while a greater diversity of
   actors in a project contributes to technological diversity.
   Overall, we conclude that a combination of innovation system and social
   network arguments provides a credible micro-level explanation for how
   the diversity of an emerging technology is created within an innovation
   system. These insights can be used to design ``smart{''} innovation
   policy instruments that influence the level of technological diversity.

   fundamental problem of a lack of innovation development in Slovakia is
   non-systematic tools focusing on companies that do not have sufficient
   resources. Although the problem is the lack of innovation knowledge
   base, as well as poor innovation management. The aim of the article is
   to provide a general picture of the innovation development of Slovakia.
   Introductory part of the article is a historical guide of innovation

   historically detailed descriptions on NSI showed a noticeable increase
   in the more recent period (20062010) analyses using more formal and
   diversified quantitative methodologies for assessing the performance of
   NSI remained lacking, reflecting its persisting methodological
   weaknesses. The roots of the NSI literature can be found at the core of
   innovation studies by certain well-known scholars in the area of
   economics of innovation and science policy research. Even though
   publications on NSI are falling in relative importance and are highly
   concentrated on a small set of countries (United Kingdom, Denmark, and

   affiliated in organisations around the world, notably in Latin America

   environmental studies, international business and managerial sciences.
   This demonstrates that the NSI literature is not self-referential.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the role that different types of future-oriented

   In countries such as the US and Germany, where FTA on nanotechnology
   were already underway in the late 1980s, the early stages of FTA relied
   on expert-based methods such as technology intelligence and technology
   forecasting to define the field and to explore what could happen in
   general. Participatory formats such as dialogues on ethical, legal and
   social aspects (ELSA) became more important only later on. Especially

   a modest effort of composing an index to be used in the evaluation of
   the creative potential of cities. Our proposed index, ``global creative
   index{''}, consists of five main criteria: (1) creativeness, (2)
   innovativeness, (3) intellectual development, (4) global network
   connectivity and (5) world cityness emphasizing multinational corporate
   economy, international division of labour and high intensity of producer
   and financial services. The use of the index is illustrated through the
   comparison of nine cities: Hong Kong, Istanbul, London, Los Angeles,
   Moscow, New York, Shanghai, Singapore and Toronto. The analysis of these
   nine cities shows that Istanbul is building an innovation environment,
   but it still lacks research and development infrastructure, technical
   support and investment in higher education. This comparison offers
   guidelines for policy-makers to sketch the growth of Istanbul along the
   lines of creativity and innovativeness.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge absorption theories argue that technologically less advanced
   companies (latecomer firms) can substantially upgrade their knowledge
   base through active knowledge absorption. These theories view knowledge
   absorption as a stepwise process which includes a linkage phase, a
   leverage phase and a learning phase (LLL concept). Case studies in
   Taiwan and Korea have shown that latecomer firms can indeed follow this
   approach and catch-up technologically with advanced firms. This paper
   aims to discuss the relevance of the LLL concept in China using the
   example of Optical Technology (OT). It reveals that the concept is not
   universally applicable. In the case of China, the ownership of companies
   determines successes and failures of strategies for increasing knowledge
   absorption. Private firms face substantial difficulties in establishing
   the necessary linkages; the upgrading of foreign-invested enterprises
   (FIEs) is controlled by their parent companies. This result has
   implications for theoretical concepts of learning and innovation in
   China, as well as for policy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The emphasis of Finnish innovation policy has very much been on

Abstract = {{ARPA-E offers a new innovation institutional model to meet energy
   technology challenges. Because it is explicitly based on DARPA, this
   article reviews the noted DARPA approach in detail. Briefly citing
   well-known features of DARPA, it explores a number of important features
   that have not been well discussed in the policy literature on DARPA.
   These include DARPA's ability to undertake multigenerational technology
   thrusts, the synergies it has been able to create through complementary
   strategic technologies, its ability to build an advocate community, and
   connections it has built to larger innovation elements downstream from
   DARPA. It has also taken on incumbent technologies within both DOD and
   in the private sector, used ties to DOD leadership to press its
   advances, and supported initial market creation. The article then
   reviews the new ARPA-E model in detail, commenting first on how ARPA-E
   has adopted key DARPA approaches. It then discusses new features ARPA-E
   is adopting, driven by the unique demands of the complex, established
   energy sector. These include new ways: (1) to sharpen the research
   visioning, selection and support processes, (2) to build a community of
   support, important to its political survival, and (3) to implement
   technologies it supports. In addition, the further DARPA features
   enumerated above provide potentially useful future guideposts to ARPA-E.
   The paper closes with a discussion of the difficult technology
   implementation problems on the ``back end{''} of the innovation
   system-including demonstrations, test beds, and initial markets. The
   article posits that both agencies must further address these
   implementation issues by fostering additional downstream partnerships,

Abstract = {{Industrial firms increasingly attempt to license their technologies

   Specifically, we distinguish proactive licensing, which refers to
   identifying recipients for technology transactions, and reactive
   licensing, which relates to offering licenses to infringers of a firm's
   intellectual property. Survey data show that environmental antecedents
   concerning appropriability, i.e., patent protection and technological
   turbulence, and determinants regarding technology markets, i.e.,
   transaction frequency and competitive intensity, have different effects

Abstract = {{Networking between companies and other regional key actors has grown
   into a widespread instrument for economic development since the 1990s.
   Participatory networks have formed the concept for many activities of
   Local Agenda 21. Simultaneously, economic geography has focused on
   network theories to explain innovation in and the economic success of
   regions.
   This article focuses on the reasons why individual actors participate in
   environmentally oriented information networks. The questions approached
   are: Does the concept of learning within networks influence a firm's
   development? How do the participants interact with each other? What
   effects do the networks have on their environment (arenas)?
   The changing arenas of a firm are analysed with regard to environmental
   concerns. These changes need to be anticipated for reliable strategies.
   To gain information and knowledge about current behaviour and
   activities, the functions of networks as learning platforms are
   discussed. Drawing upon arguments from different network theories, the
   motivations of participating in a network are threefold: actor and firm
   oriented, network internal (inter-firm), and network external. From
   these, a generic target cube of network motivations and actions is set
   up.
   The concept is reviewed by examining 12 `regional environmental
   information-oriented corporation networks' (RUN) in the Greater Munich
   Area. The empirical material reveals that this type of network does not
   provide a guarantee for significant improvements in a firm's
   environmental behaviour. However, participants learn about best
   practices while pursuing explicit or implicit aims as to influence their

   systems the coordination is `soft'; taking place through markets,
   through Government directions, and through relationships embodied in

   propensity to share innovative information with customers and
   competitors which caused the exceptional international competitiveness
   of the West German plastics industry including chemical firms, plastics
   fabricators and machine makers. The system of knowledge exchange of this
   national cluster was shaped in two main steps. In the first half of the
   20th century, cartellization and mergers were first tolerated and then
   even supported by the German government. It was in this period when
   German chemical firms formed the vertically integrated I.G. Farben
   concern which provided an optimal organisational framework to explore
   the new technological path of plastics. After the breaking up of I.G.
   Farben the firms of the West German chemical firms had to find new ways
   to maintain inter-industry technological co-operation in the second half
   of the 20th century. It turned out that they became aware of both
   contractual and non-contractual solutions of bundling standard good and
   information which were often placed somewhere between ``market{''} and
   ``hierarchy{''}. It seems to be no accident that all these different
   institutions did primarily encourage knowledge exchange between firms in

Abstract = {{The ambition to develop a bioeconomy depends largely on the forest-based
   sector. For creating higher value chains, technological innovations are
   sought in the field of lignocellulosic biorefining. Although biorefinery
   concepts have been under development for decades now in Germany, many
   relevant technological developments are still confined to the laboratory
   and pilot scale. By taking on a technological innovation systems (TIS)
   approach, this article provides an empirical analysis of the development
   of lignocellulosic biorefineries in Germany, as well as prospects and
   implications for the forest and wood sector. Specific attention is
   accorded to actors' perceptions, in particular regarding the direction
   of innovation. To this end, we discuss the conditions under which actors
   from different sectors (forest and wood industry, chemical industry and
   energy sector) interact and play different roles in the emerging field.
   The analysis highlights a number of internal and external system
   weaknesses (e.g., fragmented policies, underdeveloped market formation,
   technological immaturity, incomplete actor networks etc.). However, we
   argue that the innovation system presents a series of strengths as well.
   Besides the clear need for policy integration and coordination, the
   analysis highlights some specific policy options that could support the
   development of lignocellulosic biorefineries in Germany. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In Italy, wind solutions for the generation of electricity from

   with the existing urban properties.
   In this paper, the authors have pursued two main objectives. The first
   is an analysis of the financial feasibility resulting from the
   realization of roof-top wind turbines in the city of Bari (Southern
   Italy). This analysis was carried out through the application of a
   GIS-based decision support model. The second aim deals with the
   explanation of the mathematical relation between the aerodynamic
   parameters and the economic variables of the investment. The expressions
   obtained, on the one hand, allow to enucleate the actual influence of
   the aerodynamic parameters on the economic variables and to verify the
   empirical coherence of the outputs; while on the other, they provide
   algorithms for the rapid assessment of the performance indicators of the
   investment. The methodology developed identifies an easily repeatable

Abstract = {{The Chinese province of Shandong, and more particularly its cities

   overreliance on government policies act as main barriers. With regard to
   the Chinese specificities potentially detracting from the relevance of
   applying IS theory to China, we did not find that the central government
   acted as an initiator of innovation nor that state-owned enterprises had

Abstract = {{This article seeks to explain why Munich, Germany's most economically
   successful city in recent decades, has proved so resilient despite
   various challenges and shocks. It begins by discussing different
   theoretical understandings of resilience and our methodological approach
   which builds on complex adaptive systems and evolutionary economic
   geography perspectives. Using a blend of historical analysis and
   in-depth investigation of the dynamics of one of the city's most

   from the complex interplay of Germany's distinctive political history
   and federal system, which has promoted multi-level governance and a
   strong urban system, longstanding city regional leadership and
   entrepreneurialism, Munich's inherent assets and diverse economy and the
   combined strength of its many knowledge institutions, innovation system
   and networks. The evidence suggests that historic, structural and
   locational factors and agglomeration effects largely explain Munich's
   rise to prominence but that sustained urban and regional leadership and

Abstract = {{Regional innovation strategies rank at the top of public policy agendas
   today. There is a widespread consensus in both academic and policy
   circles that standardized ``best practice{''} innovation policy models
   suffer from severe limitations and major shortcomings. The recent
   literature is replete with claims that regional innovation policies
   should be place-based and context-sensitive, taking into consideration
   the specificities of regions and their distinctive preconditions and
   capacities for innovation. Various conceptual approaches and theories
   support such a view. This paper discusses two concepts that have a
   particularly strong potential for informing customized regional
   innovation policies: the regional innovation system (RIS) approach and
   the knowledge base concept. The RIS literature highlights the importance
   of the organizational and institutional setting of a region and suggests
   that system deficiencies or failures should constitute the starting
   point for designing regional innovation policies. The differentiated
   knowledge base approach stresses that regional industries can differ
   strongly in their underlying knowledge bases and, as a consequence, in
   their policy needs. We elaborate on the policy implications that
   originate from these concepts and argue that tailor-made regional
   innovation policies should consider both region-specific institutional
   set-ups and knowledge bases. Focusing on peripheral regions, we outline
   how such an integrated framework can inform customized regional
   innovation policies.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on regional innovation systems (RISs) has shown that

   this paper is to investigate the nature and geography of innovation,

   key questions to be answered are whether this general feature of
   Prague's innovation system (ie its fragmented structure and the lack of
   local networking) can also be found in a knowledge-intensive sector,
   such a biotechnology, or whether sectoral drivers are more significant
   and the generalized `local buzz and global pipelines' model can also be
   applied to Prague biotech firms. Our research, in contrast to previous
   studies, shows that relatively intensive linkages exist within the

Abstract = {{The relationship between knowledge investments, innovation and
   competitiveness is an important topic in both academic research and
   economic policy and has been studied extensively over the past decades.
   Nowadays, investments in private and public R\&D are believed to make up
   the heart of a modem knowledge economy. The present paper adopts an
   evolutionary economics perspective and investigates whether, in addition
   to private R\&D activities, also institutional support systems and
   policy interventions play a role in inducing innovation initiatives and
   creating impacts on the performance and competitiveness of industries.
   We aim to find support for the hypothesis that the competitiveness of
   industries in the international arena is sustained by the dynamic
   interaction between national, regional and sectoral innovation systems.
   This may provide stakeholders with a better understanding of the context
   in which they operate. Since according to the evolutionary metaphor, the
   growth of an innovation system follows complex dynamics that cannot
   simply be analysed within a static quantitative equilibrium framework,
   we use here an alternative approach based on qualitative pattern
   recognition analysis originating from artificial intelligence analysis.
   Besides R\&D expenditures, human capital expenditures are regarded as
   the major input in the knowledge creation process in our analytical
   framework To this end, in our paper a qualitative causal model that maps
   out conditional relations between key factors in national innovation
   systems will be described. The focus of our investigation is on
   systematic patterns in the competitiveness of the EU Member States,
   using statistical information on innovation input and output data from
   the European Innovation Scoreboard. In our analysis we find support for
   the hypothesis that there are indeed significant interactions between
   distinct institutional levels, which may provide guidance to the
   strategic orientation of nations and the European Union in terms of the
   emphasis on competitiveness vis-A-vis cohesion. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the question of national differences as regard the
   number of triadic patents applied for by inventors several OECD
   countries. The key idea is to determine whether such differences should
   be attributed to differences in R\&D ditures or rather to some other
   reasons, mainly institutional or behavioural ones. With this aim in
   view, both a analysis, based on aggregate data for triadic patent counts
   and R\&D expenditures and a micro-economic analysis based on data from
   three selected sectors are performed. In both cases, the methodological
   focus is made on the introduction, the and the estimation of a national
   index of relative efficiency in standard count data models. The main
   empirical findings are there is a strong heterogeneity in terms of
   performance among European countries and a strong intra-country
   heterogeneity sectors. This suggests that, in the field of innovation
   policies, there is a need for ``tailored{''} solutions reflecting the of
   each innovation system. Moreover, we show that European countries
   over-perform the United States in some high-tech tors where the
   leadership of American firms is traditionally alleged, whereas European
   firms fail to keep up in more sectors. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{This paper draws on recent conceptual approaches to economic growth, in
   which the accumulation of knowledge is the fundamental driving force
   behind growth. This fact is reflected in the trend in developed
   economies towards an increasing investment in advanced technology, R\&D,
   education, and culture. Concepts such as learning ability, creativity,
   and sustained flexibility gain greater importance as guiding principles
   for the conduct of individuals, institutions, nations, and regions. It
   is thus legitimate to question the traditional way of viewing the role
   that contemporary institutions play in the process of economic
   development and to argue for the need to promote systems of innovation
   and competence building based on learning and knowledge networks. This
   broad concept has motivated the work behind the present work, which
   reviews the strongest themes of the 4th International Conference on
   Technology Policy and Innovation (ICTPI), which was held in Curitiba,
   Parani, Brazil, in August of 2000. Under the broad designation of
   ``learning and knowledge networks,{''} the conference brought together a
   range of experts to discuss technology, policy, and management in a
   context much influenced by a dynamics of change and a necessary balance
   between the creation and diffusion of knowledge. While the idea of
   inclusive development developed in previous conferences entails a
   process of shared prosperity across the globe following local specific
   conditions, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of the process of
   knowledge accumulation, which drives a learning society. Thus, this
   special issue includes a set of extended contributions to the Curitiba
   conference that are largely grounded on empirical experiences of
   different regional and national contexts. The aim of this introductory
   paper is to set the stage for these contributions, with an original
   contribution on possible views for the learning society. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Technological innovation systems (TISs) have found favor for analyzing a
   technology's innovation dynamics, Complementary to TISs, the sectoral
   innovation systems approach focuses on sectoral peculiarities regarding
   innovation. This paper represents a first step towards integrating the
   sectoral dimension into TIS analysis. This seems particularly relevant
   for multi-component technologies, since their underlying innovation
   dynamics involve multiple sectors. We introduce the ``sectoral
   configuration{''} of a TIS, which relates to the number and types of
   sectors linked via a TIS's value chain, and elaborate how the sectoral
   configuration plays out for a TIS's functional dynamics. We apply our
   theoretical framework to the knowledge development and diffusion
   function. Based on a quantitative analysis of patent data for
   lithium-ion batteries in Japan (1985-2005), we find that different
   sectors vary in importance for knowledge development and diffusion,
   especially with regard to the technology's evolution over time. Our
   findings suggest that the sectoral configuration deserves more attention
   in future TIS analyses. This would support a better understanding of

Abstract = {{Precision farming technologies represent an innovation challenge in
   terms of their diffusion into farming practice, and create a new dynamic
   for research and extension roles. The purpose of this paper is to
   examine the interaction and distribution of research and extension roles
   of public, private, and agricultural industry organizations in precision
   farming innovation systems. We connect findings to the broader debates
   on role divisions of public and private research and extension in
   innovation systems. Two case studies were examined: precision dairy
   farming in Australia, and the use of automatic milking systems in
   north-western Europe. A timeline analysis method, underpinned by a
   functions of innovation systems framework, was used to examine
   activities of actors and organizations in the case studies. Three main
   findings were: 1) Complex agricultural innovations require a
   collaborative approach for successful innovation and diffusion. The need
   for, and type of, collaboration differs across scales from farm-level
   (individual learning) to a national and global level with issues of
   skill training and service provider capability. Additionally, a
   threshold scale is required before the commercial sector can operate
   effectively. 2) The presence, and limitations, of private (commercial)
   interests and their position as a key knowledge base in precision
   farming heightens the need for public research and extension
   organizations to promote collaborative innovation programs with
   technology companies. There is a key public or industry good role in
   providing `back-office' activities to support and complement private
   `front office' activities. 3) Public and private research and extension
   organizations can work together, however there are areas where it makes
   more sense for one party or the other to lead. For precision farming
   systems, the roles for public organizations involve leadership on data
   integration (on-farm and off-farm), integration of technology (via
   standards), testing equipment performance, and development of training
   programs including support of initiatives such as farmer clubs. The
   principle theoretical implication is that public, private and industry
   roles in research and extension should not be viewed as dichotomcius
   (e.g. precompetitive/competitive), but as highly fluid in terms of the
   moments they are needed, and the scale at which they are needed, within
   the technological innovation system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates how the Ethiopian dairy innovation system hat
   functioned to support the development of the Ethiopian dairy sector and
   what have been the major technical, economic, and institutional
   constraints in the process. We used a coupled functional-structural
   analysis of innovation systems to analyse the influence of socioeconomic
   and policy constraints on the development of the Ethiopian dairy sector.
   Results show that problems with structural elements such as the absence
   of key actors, limited capacity of existing actors, insecure property
   rights, cumbersome bureaucratic processes, poor interaction among actors
   and inadequate infrastructure have all limited dairy innovation. Out of
   the seven innovation system functions studied, our findings show that
   entrepreneurship, knowledge diffusion, market development and legitimacy
   creation have been particularly weak. Our evidence thus suggests that
   problems with certain structural elements coupled with weaknesses in
   various innovation system functions have been major hindrances to the
   uptake of technologies and dairy sector development in Ethiopia. The
   narrow policy focus on biophysical technology generation and
   dissemination, without considering the underlying problems related to
   institutional conditions and socio-economic processes, has also
   contributed to low technology adoption and limited broader development
   in the dairy sector. We suggest that combinations of institutional and

   weaknesses that have hindered dairy sector development in Ethiopia. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite the enthusiasm for technology convergence seen over the last

   there is neither any substantive evidence that technology convergence

   convergence in a technological innovation system and its change in
   status over time. Furthermore, our paper uses network analysis based on
   patent data to identify the occurrence of technology convergence in

   diffusion of technology convergence has been ongoing since the early
   2000s; (2) technology convergence is evolving into a more complex and
   heterogeneous form; (3) convergent technology has a wider scope but
   requires more effort to develop than does non-convergent technology; and

   research was evolving, and the correlation between innovation capability
   and collaboration between enterprises (EE) is weaker than that between
   academic institutes and enterprises (AE); second, the intra-regional
   collaboration intensity was higher than the inter-regional one and AE
   collaboration dominated the regional collaboration; third, during the
   process of market-oriented reform, China's major innovative regions with
   different collaborative patterns were shifting from collaborative to
   independent research, from inter-regional collaboration to
   intra-regional collaboration, and from AE to EE collaboration,

Title = {{The role of policy in shielding, nurturing and enabling offshore wind in
   The Netherlands (1973-2013)}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{It is widely acknowledged that many renewable energy technologies cannot
   (yet) compete with incumbent (fossil fuel) options e.g. in terms of
   price. Transitions literature argues that sustainable innovations can
   nevertheless break out of their `niches' if properly shielded, nurtured
   and empowered. Most studies using this perspective have focused on how
   innovation champions engage in shielding, nurturing and empowering (SNE)
   activities: none have so far focused specifically on the role that
   policy plays in relation to these three processes. This paper therefore
   aims to analyze the way in which policy constrains and enables the
   shielding, nurturing and empowering of renewable energy innovations. To
   do so, it presents a qualitative review of the development of offshore
   wind power (OWP) in The Netherlands over the past four decades. Based on
   interpretation of a wide variety of written sources (academic histories,
   reports, policy documents, parliamentary debate transcripts, news media)
   and nine semi-structured interviews, it discerns six periods of relative
   stability in the history of Dutch offshore wind. It then analyzes the
   effects of various policies on the shielding, nurturing and empowering
   of offshore wind in these periods. The paper contributes to transitions
   literature (I) by providing an analysis of how policies can enable and
   constrain the shielding, nurturing and empowering of renewable energy
   innovations, and (2) by bringing together, for the first time,
   fragmented accounts of the surprisingly long history of Dutch offshore
   wind development and implementation. Both contributions are timely,
   given the recent reprioritization of OWP on the Dutch policy agenda. (C)

   transnational linkages and an improved absorptive capacity. The latter
   benefited from past investments in knowledge development, imports of
   state-of-the-art technology and construction of a local industry
   assembling available competencies. Targeted policies (e.g. tender-based
   feed-in scheme) were effective to stimulate technology transfer and

Title = {{The diversity of systemic innovation thinking The theoretical
   underpinnings of NIS and IMP and the different assessment of an industry}},
Journal = {{IMP JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-45}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the different
   assessments of a particular industry and its ability to innovative,
   renew and prosper, but also to look into the underlying assumptions that
   are hiding behind the systemic approaches utilized in these assessments.
   The point of departure is an empirical puzzle: one group of studies
   presents a rather optimistic view of the Swedish life science industry
   and its ability to economize on research, policy and industrial
   investments. Another group of studies presents much a darker view,
   questioning the capacity of new companies to reach economic endurance,
   as well as the possibility of keeping the actually successful companies
   within the country. At a first sight it appears as if the two groups of
   studies are resting on a common theoretical ground: all seem to depart
   from a systemic innovation perspective that challenges the idea of an
   independent business landscape.
   Design/methodology/approach - The difference between the assessments
   becomes comprehensible once the authors allow for a variety of systemic
   approaches in innovation thinking. The authors propose an ideal-typical
   distinction between two types of system perspectives; those that view
   technology as entangled in its environment and those that view
   technology as disentangled from its environment. The authors use the
   national innovation system (NIS) and the industrial network ( IMP)
   approaches to exemplify the two perspectives.
   Findings - An implication of the study is that the term ``systemic
   perspective{''} is very broad and encompassing, something that in turn
   points to the importance of being clear about what the authors mean with
   a system, but also with what the theoretical assumptions focus on and
   abstract away from.
   Originality/value - The ideal-typical distinction between two types of
   system perspectives; those that view technology as entangled in its
   environment and those that view technology as disentangled from its
   environment. The authors use the NIS and the IMP approaches to exemplify
   the two perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive computing and cognitive technologies are game changers for

   computing and some of the cognitive engineering systems activities.
   The potential of cognitive technologies is outlined, along with a brief
   description of future cognitive environments, incorporating cognitive
   assistants - specialized proactive intelligent software agents designed
   to follow and interact with humans and other cognitive assistants across
   the environments. The cognitive assistants engage, individually or
   collectively, with humans through a combination of adaptive multimodal

   The realization of future cognitive environments requires the
   development of a cognitive innovation ecosystem for the engineering
   workforce. The continuously expanding major components of the ecosystem
   include integrated knowledge discovery and exploitation facilities
   (incorporating predictive and prescriptive big data analytics); novel
   cognitive modeling and visual simulation facilities; cognitive

Abstract = {{Competing models of innovation informing agricultural extension, such as
   transfer of technology, participatory extension and technology
   development, and innovation systems have been proposed over the last
   decades. These approaches are often presented as antagonistic or even
   mutually exclusive. This article shows how practitioners in a rural
   innovation system draw on different aspects of all three models, while
   creating a distinct local practice and discourse. We revisit and deepen
   the critique of Vietnam's ``model{''} approach to upland rural
   development, voiced a decade ago in this journal. Our analysis of
   interviews with grassroots extension workers and extension managers
   reveals how they have received government, donor, and academic
   discourses on participation, user-orientation, and private sector
   involvement in innovation. Extension workers as well as managers
   integrate the reform discourses into the still-dominant transfer of
   technology model. We show how extensionists draw selectively on these
   diverse discourses to foster interaction with outsiders and clients, and
   bolster their livelihood strategies. We conclude that the conceptual
   framework suggested by the innovation systems (IS) approach is broadly
   appropriate for analyzing the Vietnamese case, but that the IS approach
   in the contemporary Vietnamese context requires adaptation for taking
   into account the blurred line between private and state sectors, and
   recognizing the hegemonic position of state-based networks. Improving
   extensionists' ability to mediate between the conflicting principles of
   farmers' self-organization and government control is identified as a key
   challenge for increasing innovative capacity in rural upland Vietnam.}},

Abstract = {{Tourism in remote Outback Australia has experienced severe decline since
   the late 1990s. Outback destinations have generally failed to recognize
   the need to adapt to changing market trends and diversify their visitor
   markets. To remain competitive in the marketplace, it is argued that
   Outback destinations need to be able to operate as tourism innovation
   systems that engage the whole destination system in processes of
   collective change. This paper analyses the case of the Flinders Ranges,
   a remote destination in South Australia. It documents the strategies
   that the regional tourism system has used to diversify its market base
   and identifies the factors that have allowed the system to develop
   internal systems-of-innovation dynamics. The findings suggest that the
   Flinders Ranges tourism system has been able to overcome internal
   structural weaknesses by the `import' of externally trained
   entrepreneurs and public sector leaders. The paper finally questions the
   role of centralized state and regional tourism organizations that seem
   to have stifling effects on innovation capacities in remote

Abstract = {{Knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) play a key role in the
   innovation system as carriers, sources and facilitators of innovation.
   Thus, there is a real need for improved intellectual property (IP)
   protection in the case of the KIBS enterprises. Former studies have
   mainly focused on formal IPR but in more recent discussions the
   importance of informal IP protection has been underlined. This study
   investigates IP protection and management practices in small service
   firms. The results demonstrate that besides formal protection methods,
   IP is also protected by many informal ways that involve extremely
   heterogeneous range of practices and strategies. At best these informal
   ways are simple, easy to control and economical to use, and often they
   are an integral part of a firm's daily routines.}},

   alternative of RD services in the German innovation system. The article
   presents several case studies as specific forms of such partnerships,

   a framework in which knowledge flows are triggered, personnel mobility

Abstract = {{The Danish Atomic Energy Commission (AEK) was created in 1955 with the
   remit to promote `the peaceful exploitation of atomic energy for the
   benefit of society.' Between 1956 and 1963 the AEK, which had been
   preceded by a number of early private nuclear initiatives, established
   an ambitious atomic energy research facility at RisO, some 40 kilometers
   west of Copenhagen. For most of this period the AEK was chaired by the
   celebrated physicist Niels Bohr. In spite of strong support from
   relevant actors in Danish society and RisO's management, Denmark never
   built commercial nuclear power stations. Today RisO has undergone a
   complete metamorphosis from atomic energy research facility to a
   national laboratory, doing research and development on a broad range of
   alternative energy sources. Using concepts and approaches like national
   innovation systems and technological nationalism, the present paper will
   explore why and how this remarkable development took place.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{305-321}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to integrate the global value
   chain (GVC) perspective with firms' innovation in emerging economies
   (EEs) and explain why EE firms can improve their innovation capabilities
   more from their domestic markets by focusing on R\&D and marketing than
   from original equipment manufacturer/original design manufacturer
   (OEM/ODM) modes in the GVC and how they contribute to the national
   innovation system (NIS).
   Design/methodology/approach - The literature on GVC is reviewed and then
   several propositions are developed using the example of the underground
   mobile phone developers in China by integrating the GVC perspective.
   Findings - The paper proposes that EE firms, especially firms that have
   a large underdeveloped domestic market such as China, should focus on
   R\&D and marketing instead of on OEM/ODM in GVC to increase their
   competitiveness and strengthen their NIS. Also implications are drawn
   from their success in the underground markets to advance knowledge on
   NIS.
   Originality/value - The paper shows that EE firms can build and
   strengthen their innovation capabilities through intense interaction and
   learning in domestic markets, which, subsequently, moves them upwards in
   their GVC. Industrial policy needs to change in order to facilitate such
   technological entrepreneurship in NIS, whether it is informal or

Abstract = {{Studies of innovation systems and policies have tended to focus on
   scientific and technological innovation; organisational innovations
   continue to receive scant attention in many countries. The purpose of
   this article is to study the frontrunner countries in organisational
   innovation activities, in this case Germany, Norway, Sweden and Finland,
   as well as the ways in which they have integrated organisational
   innovations as a part of broader innovation policies. The evaluation
   framework consists of four levels: (1) governmental and strategic level;
   (2) ministerial level; (3) research and development (R\&D) programme
   level; and (4) performance level. This article discusses innovation
   systems' similarities and differences from the organisational innovation
   point of view and suggests future recommendations for policy-makers.
   Although the results show that the countries studied support
   organisational innovation R\&D projects and programmes, only Finland and
   Sweden have been able to create broad-based innovation strategies at the
   governmental level that include organisational innovation. Even so, a
   stronger political commitment is needed to foster a comprehensive
   approach to innovation and support the legitimacy of organisational
   innovation. In the future, it will be necessary to systematically embed
   an organisational innovation perspective into innovation systems
   throughout the governmental, ministerial, R\&D programme and performance
   levels. To enhance learning concerning innovation activities in Europe,
   a concrete tool for a joint learning platform in the field of innovation
   activities is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{R\&D internationalization has increasingly involved countries outside

Abstract = {{Innovation, a broad social and economic activity within emerging
   societies, transcends any specific technology, even if revolutionary,
   and is tied to attitudes and behaviours oriented towards the
   exploitation of change by adding value. In this context, we analyse
   on-going paths towards innovative societies taking into consideration
   their sustainable development. The solution-space for innovation for
   sustainability is characterised by three dimensions: 1) the entire
   lifespan of a product; 2) the entire socio-technic network of which a
   particular plant is part of, or from which a particular product emerges;
   and 3) stakeholders and decision processes, including business
   organisations and strategies; and public institutions, policy and
   regulatory frameworks. All theses three dimensions are shown to be
   critically related with the social appropriation of a broad knowledge
   base, which calls our special attention to the systems of innovation and
   competence building shaping our societies. Societies and their
   organisations differ in their approach to sustainability. Distinguishing
   between different types of stakeholders helps to elucidate barriers to
   change, and to exploit the solution-space for innovation. The
   contributions in this Special Issue illustrate various dimensions of the
   innovation-space and their related knowledge base. The examples
   addressed support the conclusion that the framework presented has
   general applicability to analyse and foster innovation for

Abstract = {{In Australia, the federal (central) and State (regional) governments
   share constitutional responsibility for aspects of science and
   innovation policy. In practice, the federal government has tended to
   overshadow the States both in funding and policy for research and
   innovation. It can be argued that we are now seeing the strong rebirth
   of regionalism (at least at the State level) as far as government
   support for science, technology and knowledge-based industries is
   concerned. The paper traces the growth of regional innovation policies
   through examples of initiatives from South Australia and other regions
   and examines the respective contributions of the State and federal
   governments. The character of State government support has evolved over
   the last 15 years, from sponsoring grand `technology citadels' to
   today's strategies that take a more bottom-up approach to building
   intense innovation environments, local clusters and knowledge hubs. Some
   of these trends reflect the influence of the global knowledge economy on
   regional industries, while others (notably the relative decline of the
   federal government as an R\&D performer) are peculiarities of the
   Australian innovation system. The outcome is a significant evolution in
   Australia's innovation system, one which parallels responses to
   globalisation in other countries and suggests a different - but not
   diminished role for public sector innovation policy.}},

   specific national case study may serve for more general comparative

   complexity and differences existing in Europe. By using the analytical
   framework of the ``national systems of innovation{''} concept, we have
   performed a multistep analysis of the biotechnology sector in Spain,
   focussing first on regions of Madrid and Cataluna which together account
   for more than 50\% of the sector in Spain. The firms in both regions
   have followed a common strategy based on diversification and investment
   in R\&D and innovation, so as to be able to compete in an international
   and competitive environment. There are, however, some interesting
   differences between the two subsectors; the one from Cataluna being more
   based on industrial traditions, and the one from Madrid characterised by
   the emergence of more specialised firms. The study has been extended to
   the remainder of Spanish firms for comparative purposes. The case of
   Spain is illustrative of the divergences existing in the biotechnology
   sector in Europe. A comparison is made with the structural and
   organisational characteristics of the biotechnology sector in several

Abstract = {{Improving the effectiveness of innovation requires R\&D management to
   resolve the dilemma of risk management through the discovery of

   capabilities can be economically developed and how latent demands among
   potential customers can be met by those new capabilities. Because
   customers and other stakeholders need to experience new capabilities to
   adequately understand and assess their value, traditional marker
   research is inadequate in revealing latent needs. To help resolve the
   dilemma, R\&D is redefined in a new innovation system with a focus on
   leveraged and concurrent shared learning. Participatory research with
   stakeholder testing of prototypes is coupled with a new business process

Abstract = {{Science, technology and innovation (STI) policy is shaped by persistent
   framings that arise from historical context. Two established frames are
   identified as co-existing and dominant in contemporary innovation policy
   discussions. The first frame is identified as beginning with a
   Post-World War II institutionalisation of government support for science
   and R\&D with the presumption that this would contribute to growth and
   address market failure in private provision of new knowledge. The second
   frame emerged in the 1980s globalising world and its emphasis on
   competitiveness which is shaped by the national systems of innovation
   for knowledge creation and commercialisation. STI policy focuses on
   building links, clusters and networks, and on stimulating learning
   between elements in the systems, and enabling entrepreneurship. A third
   frame linked to contemporary social and environmental challenges such as
   the Sustainable Development Goals and calling for transformative change
   is identified and distinguished from the two earlier frames.
   Transformation refers to socio-technical system change as conceptualised
   in the sustainability transitions literature. The nature of this third
   framing is examined with the aim of identifying its key features and its
   potential for provoking a re-examination of the earlier two frames. One
   key feature is its focus on experimentation, and the argument that the
   Global South does not need to play catch-up to follow the transformation
   model of the Global North. It is argued that all three frames are
   relevant for policymaking, but exploring options for transformative
   innovation policy should be a priority.}},

   review of the interdisciplinary literature that addresses the links
   between the activities of hospitals and medical innovation. It
   identifies three major research streams: studies of the contribution of
   medical research and clinical staff to innovation, analyses of novel
   practices developed and diffused in hospitals, and evolutionary studies
   of technical change in the context of human health care. This is a
   highly heterogeneous body of literature, in which comprehensive
   theoretical frameworks are rare, and empirical studies have tended to
   focus on a narrow range of hospitals' innovation activities. The paper
   introduces and discusses a framework integrating different perspectives
   that can be used to analyze the functions performed by hospitals at the
   intersection with different partners in the health innovation system and
   at different stages of innovation trajectories. On the basis of current
   gaps in the literature, a research agenda is discussed for a relational
   and co-evolutionary approach to the study of hospitals as innovators.

Abstract = {{Knowledge acquisition and development of capabilities constitutes a key
   perspective in studies regarding the formation of new ventures. When
   examining entrepreneurship ecosystems, we find that the composition of a

   aim of this study is to examine the influence of the new venture, the
   entrepreneur's social capital, and the firm performance on the new
   venture's knowledge acquisition activities. In particular, the study
   examines how the institutional context of a region influences new
   ventures' knowledge acquisition actions during its growth, and in turn
   the level of sustained entrepreneurial activity within the region. The
   paper focuses on the formation of alliances by new ventures, one
   particular form of knowledge acquisition process that has been
   established as critical to new venture success in the high technology
   sector. The mechanisms for acquiring and transforming knowledge have the
   greatest impact on new venture formation, and in this context, the
   concepts of strategic knowledge arbitrage and strategic knowledge
   serendipity (SKARSE (TM)) are validated through an agent-based

Abstract = {{Knowledge transfer between universities and organizations is essential,

   examines few of the cooperation activities that exist in practice. This
   article offers a comprehensive review and analysis of an extensive set
   of barriers and drivers across seven UBC activities with a large sample
   of European academics from 33 countries. Results highlight that while
   the identified drivers significantly affect the development of all
   cooperation activities, barriers have more diverse effects. While
   significantly limiting research and valorization activities, they barely
   impact cooperation in education. Additionally, results show that even if
   academics perceive no barriers they still may not cooperate with
   business if there are no drivers in place. This article concludes by
   discussing the relevant implications for research, management and policy
   development regarding UBC, leading to directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a tentative theory linking economic and innovation dynamics
   with the ways capital cities try to develop and position themselves
   through the formulation of locational policies. Global and world city
   theories challenge the traditional role and centrality of capital
   cities. Capital cities that are not the economic centers of their
   nations so-called secondary capital cities - tend to be overlooked in
   the fields of economic geography and political science. Consequently,
   there is a lack of research and resulting theory analyzing their
   political economy. We put forward an interdisciplinary perspective that
   is informed by theories of economic geography and political science, as
   processes of economic development and political positioning are
   interrelated and need to be examined together. By linking three
   different theoretical strands - the regional innovation system approach,
   the concept of locational policies, and the policy regime perspective -
   this paper proposes a framework to study the economic and political
   dynamics in secondary capital cities. Examples of secondary capital
   cities such as Bern, Canberra, Ottawa, The Hague and Washington D.C.

Abstract = {{Environmental innovation has been discussed from different approaches in
   the last decade, due to its increasing importance for business
   competitiveness and as an engine for the economic development of a
   country, especially in recessionary economic phases. However, the study
   of the factors that hinder the achievement of environmental innovations
   has been largely neglected. This paper focuses on the obstacles facing
   firms involved in environmental innovations and how they still manage to
   achieve these innovations. The data used comes from the Community
   Innovation Survey (CIS) conducted in Spain in the year 2012, while the
   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and binary logistic regression are the
   statistical techniques used. The findings show that the obstacles that
   companies involved in environmental innovations face are greater and
   different to those faced by companies which are not involved in them.
   Consequently, environmental innovation requires different action plans
   from those for non-environmental innovation; these actions include
   public funding, and cooperation, as well as other specific support
   measures. This research provides a systematic framework for
   environmental innovation and the ways to overcome the barriers to this
   innovation. Thereby supplying a roadmap for the creation of an
   innovation system that constitutes a favourable context for overcoming
   these obstacles, thus bringing about the success of the environmental

Abstract = {{This article aims at assessing the diversity of regional innovation
   systems and their economic performance in Europe. We propose to adapt
   the social systems of innovation and production (SSIP) framework at the
   regional level by identifying the specific arrangements of each part of
   the innovation and production system. Three key features of European
   regions are investigated using this framework: the diversity of regional
   SSIP, the interplay of regional and national determinants of such
   systems, and the impact of SSIP on regional performance. We identify a
   typology of regional configurations resulting from the combination of
   scientific, technological, educational and industrial indicators, using
   multivariate data analysis. A variance analysis approach is then
   developed in order to test the existence of specific regional growth
   regimes. The results highlight a persistently high level of diversity of
   regional configurations, notably among knowledge intensive regions, but
   also show that national institutional settings remain of fundamental
   importance in shaping a number of regional configurations. A final
   conclusion relates to the weak correlation observed between the
   structural characteristics of regions and their performance over the
   2003-2007 period: regional performance remains primarily shaped by
   national trends. Overall, the paper questions the regional dimension of
   these ``systems{''}.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that current technology-driven implementations of
   Smart Cities, although being an important step in the right direction,
   fall short in exploiting the most important human dimension of cities.
   The paper argues therefore in support of the concept of Human Smart
   Cities.
   In a Human Smart City, people rather than technology are the true actors
   of the urban ``smartness{''}. The creation of a participatory innovation
   ecosystem in which citizens and communities interact with public
   authorities and knowledge developers is key. Such collaborative
   interaction leads to co-designed user centered innovation services and
   calls for new governance models.
   The urban transformation in which citizens are the main ``drivers of
   change{''} through their empowerment and motivation ensures that the
   major city challenges can be addressed, including sustainable behavior
   transformations.
   Furthermore, the authors argue that the city challenges can be more
   effectively addressed at the scale of neighborhood and they provide
   examples and experiences that demonstrate the viability, importance and
   impact of such approach.
   The paper builds on the experience of implementing Human Smart Cities
   projects in 27 European cities located in 17 different countries.

Abstract = {{Many contemporary science systems are witnessing the rise of
   public-private research programs that aim to build capacity for research
   and innovation in strategic areas. These programs create a significant
   policy challenge: how to select-based on ex ante evaluations-a

   programs funded by the `Investment Grants for Knowledge Infrastructure'
   (Besluit Subsidies Investeringen Kennisinfrastructuur) in 2004. Our
   research question is as follows: to what extent can involvement and
   commitment of knowledge users in the stage of drawing up the program
   proposal serve as a predictor of their later involvement and financial
   contribution? Using available archival data on the programs, we show
   that on average there is a close association between user involvement in
   the proposals of public-private research consortia and their eventual
   involvement during the implementation, but that there are substantial
   differences between plans and implementation in individual cases. Our
   analysis suggests that selecting consortia for funding based on their

   necessary to safeguard the financial contributions of knowledge users.}},

   stable and the changing uses of the word over the decades are examined.
   Considering the results in the light of `stylised facts' in innovation
   policy studies reveals that use of the term innovation has increased
   over the period studied. It has entered a wide variety of policy domains
   and it has been used in an increasingly positive tone. It has been
   associated with both drivers and barriers to innovation, with greater
   emphasis on government as the driver of innovation, despite oscillations
   between the public and private sectors over the period. The implications
   of a broadening of the meaning of innovation are discussed, and the
   paper considers whether increasing usage of the term reflects growing
   familiarity with the `Systems of Innovation' approach among policy
   makers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Encouraging system learning in two poultry subsectors}},

Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{29-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This article contributes to the debate on participatory approaches to
   bring about system changes that support sustainability and other broad
   innovation challenges. We report on experiences of workshops in two
   Dutch poultry subsectors where actors from the value chains together
   with a few other actors and facilitated by researchers, conducted an
   analysis of the structural barriers and windows of opportunity for
   innovation. In this way, we investigate the value of these collective
   system analyses in a wider approach for system innovation towards
   sustainable animal sectors. We expected that they would stimulate system
   learning among the participants: i.e. (1) recognising the
   multi-causality of recurrent problems, (2) redefining barriers into
   opportunities, and (3) designing options for collective action. The
   participants indeed recognised the integral and complex nature of the
   sustainability issues, and their commitment to sustainable development
   increased. However, the learning was limited in the sense that they
   defined few innovation opportunities and no options for collective
   actions. After analysing whether the workshops actively challenged the
   innovation barriers in the current subsectors, we conclude that the
   latter two dimensions of system learning seem to have been hindered by
   the representation of a large part of the value chains in the workshops.
   Our experiences provide new insights on how to stimulate a learning
   process geared towards overcoming lock-in in the incumbent
   production-consumption systems. Collective system analyses can be a
   relevant additional method for participatory innovation approaches. The
   innovation system perspective broadens the scope of the system and helps
   to distinguish the structures underlying current unsustainable
   practices. We suggest not seeking completeness by trying to bring all
   relevant value chain actors to the table at the same time, but rather
   organising multiple workshops with both value chain actors and
   innovating actors who operate more independently from the dominant
   system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As it has now been widely argued, innovation is ever more seldom the
   product of isolated firms but usually requires a combination of multiple
   technologies, skills and competences, part of which have to be acquired
   from outside the boundaries of the innovating firm. As the literature on
   regional systems of innovation and other territorial innovation models
   suggests, the region is the most appropriate spatial level for
   investigating and understanding the nature of firms' external knowledge
   acquisition in their innovation processes, as well as for identifying
   the critical actors and factors contributing to them. Unlike the
   majority of studies focusing on the innovation activities of firms at
   the regional level, this paper focuses not on the actual importance of
   different location factors, but on the perceptions of small- and
   medium-sized firms entrepreneurs of the quality of different factors in
   their regional innovation environment. By identifying differences
   between the perceptions of innovative and less-innovative firms, this
   study contributes to the literature on innovation as a regional-level
   phenomenon, and also tentatively puts forward some managerial and policy
   implications, as well as suggestions for further research.}},

Abstract = {{Research in the domain of `Innovation Studies' has been claimed to allow
   for the study of how technology will develop in the future. Some suggest
   that the National and Sectoral Innovation Systems literature has become
   bogged down, however, into case studies of how specific institutions
   affect innovation in a specific country. A useful notion for policy
   makers in particular, Balzat and Hanusch (2004 Recent trends in the
   research on national innovation systems Journal of Evolutionary
   Economics 14(2): 197-210) argued that there is a need for NIS studies to
   develop complementary and also quantitative methods in order to generate
   new insights that are comparable across national borders. We use data
   for patents granted by the World Intellectual Property Organization
   (WIPO) to map innovation systems. Groupings of patents into primary and
   secondary classes (co-classification) can be used as relational
   indicators. Knowledge from one class may be more easily used in another
   class when a co-classification relation exists. Using social network
   analysis, we map the co-classification of patents among classes and thus
   indicate what characterizes an innovation system.
   A main contribution of this paper is methodological, adding to the
   repertoire of methods NIS studies use and using information from patents
   in a different way. Policy makers may also find benefits in the social
   network analysis of the complete set of patents granted by the WIPO to
   firms and individuals in a country. Social network analysis indicates
   what innovation activity occurs in a countries and which fields of
   technology are likely to give rise to innovative products in the near
   future. We offer such analysis for the Dutch and Indian Innovation
   Systems. This social network analysis could also be done for a sector
   innovation system, and we do so for nanotech to determine empirically
   the knowledge field relevant for this emerging scientific domain.}},

Abstract = {{Innovations are the driving force for agricultural development under
   present diverse situations of uncertainty. The innovation system
   perspective acknowledges the contributions made by all stakeholders
   involved in knowledge development, dissemination and appropriation.
   According to the specific agricultural production system, farmers adopt
   innovations, modify them or innovate on their own. This paper examines
   the role of farmers' experiments and innovations in Cuba's agricultural
   innovation system (AIS), identifies knowledge exchange encounters and
   describes some strategies implemented to institutionalize farmers'
   experiments and innovations. The research methods comprised 34
   semi-structured interviews with agricultural experts from the science,
   administration and advisory system, and 31 free list questionnaires to
   assess the institutional influence on farmers' experiments and
   innovations. In addition, three case studies of outstanding farmers'
   experiments are presented. The results suggest that the government's
   commitment to social participation in knowledge development provides the
   basic prerequisite for an effective integration of farmers' experiments
   and innovation in Cuba. The historically conditioned vertical structure
   of knowledge development and dissemination is gradually changing toward
   more horizontal procedures. The dynamic exchange of ideas at all kinds
   of interactive meetings, such as workshops or farmers' field schools,
   have favored farmer to farmer learning as well as knowledge sharing with
   research, academic and extension officials. This multi-stakeholders'
   approach contributes to institutionalize farmers' knowledge. Farmers'
   experiments and innovations play a major role in improving farm
   management and thereby can contribute to build resilience at the farming
   system level as well as for the national agricultural system.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The paper elaborates the notion of innovation as an emerging property of
   complex system dynamics and presents an agent-based simulation model
   (ABM) of an economy where systemic knowledge interactions among
   heterogeneous agents are crucial for the recombinant generation of new
   technological knowledge and the introduction of innovations. In this
   approach the organization of the system plays a crucial role in
   assessing the chances of individual firms to actually introduce
   innovations because it qualifies the access to external knowledge, an
   indispensable input, together with internal learning and research
   activities, into the recombinant generation of new knowledge. The
   introduction of innovations is analyzed as the result of systemic
   knowledge interactions among myopic agents that are credited with an
   extended procedural rationality that includes forms of creative
   reaction. The creative reaction of agents may lead to the introduction
   of productivity enhancing innovations. This takes place only when the
   structural, organizational and institutional characteristics of the
   system are such that agents, reacting to out-of-equilibrium conditions,
   can actually take advantage of external knowledge available within the
   innovation system into which they are embedded to generate new
   technological knowledge. The ABM enables one to explore effects of
   alternative organizational features of the systems, namely different
   configurations of the intellectual property right regimes and different
   architectural configurations of the regional structure into which
   knowledge interactions take place, on the rates of introduction of
   technological innovations. The results of the ABM suggest that the
   dissemination of knowledge favors the emergence of creative reactions
   and hence faster rates of introduction of technological innovations.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses scale-independent indicators to explore the Chinese
   national and regional innovation systems during economic transition. Our
   perception of an innovation system is frequently informed by
   conventional indicators based on linear assumptions while actually
   innovation systems may behave differently. Scale-independent indicators
   characterize non-linear properties of an innovation system. They can
   give decision makers deeper insight into the dynamics of innovation
   systems, and they may lead to more practical public policies {[}Katz, J.
   S. (2006). Indicators for complex innovation systems. Research Policy,
   35, 893-909].
   As reported for the European and Canadian innovation systems the Chinese
   systems exhibited scaling correlations between GERD (Gross Expenditure
   on Domestic R\&D) and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) over time and at
   points in time. The scaling factors of the correlations tell us that
   between 1995 and 2005 the Chinese GERD exhibited a strong nonlinear
   tendency to increase with GDP. Furthermore they show that the GERD of
   the Western region is growing much slower than its GDP as compared with
   Eastern and Central regions. This observation has policy implications
   suggesting further improvements need to be made to the research
   infrastructure and funding of the Western region.
   The GDP-POP (Population) scaling factor shows that the `wealth
   intensity' or GDP per capita is increasing much faster than the
   exponential growth of the Chinese population. In contrast the systemic
   GDP-POP scaling factor shows that regional development is non-linear.
   Finally, the paper-GDP and patent-GDP scaling factors tell us that
   outputs of science and technology for China are growing faster than
   economic growth. The systemic paper-GDP and patent-GDP scaling factors
   show that the growth rates are uneven across the provinces. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The management of technology embodies human choice and freedom, and as
   such, it may not detach from philosophy and psychology, particularly in
   the innovation, knowledge and learning paradigm. This paradigm heralds
   knowledge workers in systems of innovation with renewed emphasis on
   information and intellectual capital as the primary assets for
   production. The thinking styles and cognitive preferences for technical
   knowledge workers are pertinent for sustaining the interrelationships
   between economic and environmental, social and political, science and
   technology agents, institutions and organisations. Based on a 2005
   survey and descriptive statistics of primary data obtained from 330
   respondents, this paper provides a review of cognitive mechanisms while
   discussing the ranking of preferred thinking styles for engineering and
   technology management in the new paradigm. Logical, problem solving,
   conceptualising, analysing and interpersonal thinking styles were ranked
   in the top five by ajudgemental sample comprising engineering, science
   and technology oriented professionals in supervisory, middle to senior
   management positions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH POLICY}},

Volume = {{81}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This article has two objectives. It firstly provides a general framework
   for variables that influence R\&D (Research and Development)
   localisation by pharmaceutical and biotech companies. The analysis of
   R\&D localization includes both in-house R\&D and contracted R\&D.
   Following a systematic literature search, these variables were
   classified into four distinct categories: regulatory environment,
   institutional framework, national systems of innovation and local
   development and specialisation. The authors highlight that some of these
   factors directly depend on the action of public administrations (e.g.,
   patent protection, price regulation, public investments in research, and
   incentives to private companies); others are indirectly influenced by
   public policies (e.g., GDP growth rate, infrastructures). This
   theoretical framework was used to analyse the Italian case-study. Pros
   and cons of the Italian context were investigated from the point of view
   of multinational pharmaceutical companies and the Italian Association of
   Biotech Companies. Interviews were chosen as the most appropriate data
   gathering technique given the exploratory nature of the study of the
   Italian context.
   The paper is divided into five parts. A brief introduction provides
   figures showing that Europe has been loosing positions compared with
   other Continents and the same has occurred in Italy compared with other
   EU countries. The second one illustrates the methodology. The third one
   is focused on variables affecting R\&D localisation. In the fourth
   section the Italian case-study is discussed. Theoretical and empirical
   findings are gummarised and discussed in the conclusions. (c) 2006

   system, and of its spread, particularly in the farming and
   agricultural-science sector initially, and subsequently in technological
   and industrial areas (physical technologies and the transport equipment
   industry). Four main periods are described, corresponding to changes in
   types of institutional behaviour in relation to innovation: a phase of
   setting up pioneering institutions and innovations (1827-1911), a phase
   of growth and influence of the agricultural-science institutions
   (1911-62), a phase of rupture, economic diversification and development

Abstract = {{The importance of advanced users in home markets as an inducement to

   At the theoretical level upstream-downstream interaction has been made
   the generic micro-foundation of theories of national systems of

   interaction is not the only (country-specific) inducement mechanism to

   proposition that when firms are science-based, linkages tend to be
   horizontal rather than vertical. The paper mobilises historical and
   bibliometric methods to trace the long-term development of technology at
   the Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, and its links with the
   local (particularly university) environment. The paper demonstrates the

   Network structures are different in different industries, markets, and

   this data-driven workflow is applied to a set of synthetic additive

   understand how universities may be able to leverage both their knowledge

   hand, it is found that academics in uncompetitive regions are more
   intensively engaged in entrepreneurial activities but generate less
   income from them than their counterparts in competitive regions,
   suggesting that there are differences in the income-generating capacity

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a unique database, the Corporate Invention Board
   (CIB). The CIB combines patent data from the PATSTAT database with
   financial data from the ORBIS database about the 2289 companies with the
   largest R\&D investments. We illustrate the database by showing a
   comprehensive overview of national and sectoral patterns of R\&D
   internationalization by multinational corporations in the period
   1993-2005. The results show heterogeneity in sectoral and national
   patterns of internationalization. These patterns have remained
   relatively stable over the 1993-2005 period. China is among the least
   internationalized countries and European countries, especially the UK
   and the Netherlands, are among the most internationalized countries. The
   largest countries in terms of patent production, such as Germany and the
   US, have internationalization profiles that can be very well predicted
   based upon their sectoral composition. Other country profiles, however,
   diverge significantly from the prediction based on sectoral profile.
   Asian countries are on average less internationalized than would be
   expected, whereas the European countries and Canada are more
   internationalized. We find that while national level indicators explain
   a large part of the variance observed in the ability of countries to
   attract R\&D from foreign multinationals, there are significant
   differences between sectors and this has large implications for the
   design of foreign R\&D and innovation policies. The CIB opens up a wide
   array of opportunities to study the internationalization strategies of
   firms and countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   process of technology diffusion as well as the emergence of a new wind
   sector in Portugal, where this renewable energy technology showed a
   spectacular development in the past decade. This framework highlights
   the main processes or functions that occur in the diffusion of a new
   technology. The evidence obtained demonstrates that the fulfillment of
   these functions, which were mostly studied in the context of pioneer
   countries, is still pertinent to explain the formation of a wind energy
   system in this follower country. Yet the type of resources and the
   nature of the activities needed to adopt the technology in the latter
   often differ. This case provides new insights into the importance of
   functions that enhance the follower's capacity to assimilate the new
   technology (e.g. local knowledge development, experimentation), thus
   creating the conditions for a fast move as soon as innovations become
   sufficiently mature in the core. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Modern society is characterised by rapid technological development that
   is often socially controversial and plagued by extensive scientific
   uncertainty concerning its socio-ecological impacts. Within this
   context, the concept of `responsible research and innovation' (RRI) is
   currently rising to prominence in international discourse concerning
   science and technology governance. As this emerging concept of RRI
   begins to be enacted through instruments, approaches, and initiatives,
   it is valuable to explore what it is coming to mean for and in practice.
   In this paper we draw attention to a realm that is often backgrounded in
   the current discussions of RRI but which has a highly significant impact
   on scientific research, innovation and policy-namely, the interstitial
   space of international standardization. Drawing on the case of nanoscale
   sciences and technologies to make our argument, we present examples of
   how international standards are already entangled in the development of
   RRI and yet, how the process of international standardization itself
   largely fails to embody the norms proposed as characterizing RRI. We
   suggest that although current models for RRI provide a promising attempt
   to make research and innovation more responsive to societal needs,
   ethical values and environmental challenges, such approaches will need
   to encompass and address a greater diversity of innovation system agents
   and spaces if they are to prove successful in their aims.}},

Abstract = {{Companies face challenges and need support when applying specific
   knowledge to their innovation processes, such as design for
   sustainability. The providers of innovation support in innovation
   systems are intermediaries. While the literature on intermediaries
   focuses on various roles and approaches, the way in which intermediaries
   function in specific fields such as design for sustainability remains
   underexplored. This paper investigates how intermediaries provide
   innovation support in the design for sustainability field today, with a
   focus on the services and support they offer, the approaches and drivers
   that shape them, as well as the challenges of the intermediation
   process, particularly concerning sustainability and design. To do this,
   14 intermediaries from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Turkey
   were investigated through case studies. The role of design in support
   processes, especially during implementation, the importance and types of
   collaborations among various actors of innovation systems, and the
   emergence of a new type of intermediary that promises radical innovation
   in sustainability are among the findings. In addition, based on the
   empirical data, we suggest a framework for describing the roles and
   attributes of a group of five intermediaries that meets the needs of all
   types of companies engaged in design for sustainability. Finally we
   offer suggestions for Turkey on how to raise the capacity of its
   intermediaries operating in the design for sustainability field, which
   might be applicable to other similar contexts as well. This study
   contributes to the theory and practice of innovation support in the
   sustainability field, from which all innovation system's actors,
   especially intermediaries and governmental institutions, might benefit
   in designing support programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Knowledge transfer between actors in the innovation system: a study of
   higher education institutions (HEIS) and SMES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS \& INDUSTRIAL MARKETING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3-4, SI}},
Pages = {{436-458}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how and why small
   to medium enterprises (SMEs) access knowledge from external actors in
   general and from higher education institutions (HEIs) in particular and
   what is the extent to which these knowledge access pathways affect SME
   innovativeness.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper involved both quantitative and
   qualitative approaches: a survey of 1,226 SMEs and a mini case study to
   follow-up on issues arising from the survey analysis. Survey data were
   analysed using both non-parametric and multivariate Poisson regression
   analysis. The case study was based on a medium-sized manufacturing firm
   in South Australia.
   Findings - While there are significant differences between the micro-,
   small- and medium-sized enterprises, the evidence suggests that SMEs
   generally use ``generic{''} university-industry knowledge transfer
   pathways (e.g. published research results) rather than
   university-industry links with high ``relational{''} involvement. More
   significantly, the results indicate that SMEs are more likely to rely on
   organisations other than universities and related R\&D enterprises for
   knowledge acquisition like clients/customers or suppliers. While
   collaboration is most likely to occur within the same state/territory,
   or Australia, many SMEs also collaborate internationally, usually as
   part of normal supplier-customer relationships, reinforcing knowledge
   acquisition from organisationally proximate partners. These findings are
   also supported by the case study.
   Research limitations/implications - This research was limited to
   surveying SMEs in one geographic (metropolitan) region in Australia. It
   also does not account for the different patterns of HEI-SME interactions
   in different industry sectors. There is also only one case study.
   Originality/value - First, the research adds to the few field studies
   that have investigated accessing knowledge for innovation among SMEs.
   Specifically, the research contributes to an understanding of the
   heterogeneous roles that different actors play in facilitating knowledge
   access for improving innovative SMEs outcomes. Second, the research does
   not treat all SMEs similarly in terms of size effects but instead
   accounts for differing SME sizes and how this affects their selection of
   knowledge access pathways. Third, the research contributes to a small
   number of studies that attempt to understand how HEIs and SMEs can work
   better together in the context of a regional innovation system,
   especially one that is relatively less competitive to the larger
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{Effectively implementing various energy and environmental policies
   contributes to the acceleration of energy performance, a reduction in

   MEEMS needs to be effectively applied in order to implement policy

   dynamics of the MEES (municipal energy and environmental system), and
   the new conceptual organisation of MEEMS, a need for the inclusion of
   innovative elements can be defined regarding support mechanisms.
   Integration of the end-user approach defines the fundamental orientation

   understand innovation in Maine's logging industry, a series of cases
   studies involving 10 innovative logging firms was performed. Results
   show that logging innovations are very capital intensive and carry high
   risk for the adopting firm. Logging innovation is typically focused on
   increasing profitability and production efficiency, but a given
   contractor's desire to conduct high-quality work can moderate these
   influences. Finally, the logging innovation system is strong with

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the relationship between technological innovation
   and finance. The financial market must be regarded as one of the
   fundamental prerequisites of innovation, inasmuch as it is here that
   decisions are made on capital allocation to enterprises. However, less
   has been written on the interdependencies between the patterns of
   corporate finance and governance on the one hand and company innovation
   strategies on the other. The paper takes up these open questions. It
   analyses the transformation process of the German innovation system due
   to the dynamics of the financial market in the last decades. In
   conclusion, some general insight into the relationship between finance
   and innovation beyond the German context will be provided. The paper is
   based on an extensive literature research in the fields of economic
   sociology and innovation studies and the analysis of the public debate

Abstract = {{Firm success is often associated with the development of better

   by capitalizing on the freely accessible results of basic research. But
   unpatentable basic research often fails to address applied R\&D open
   problems. What is the role of the incentives in improving the innovative
   performance of an economy by matching partially motivated public
   researchers to their mission? Sometimes government-funded research
   projects are mission-directed, and yet in many cases the public sector
   academics indulge in carrier-driven research. An innovation system
   where, as in the United States, basic research is also driven by patents
   implicitly sets an ex-post incentive to the researchers guided by
   invisible hand. For a public innovation system - like the European one -
   designing an incentive scheme to motivate public researchers is of key
   importance for fostering the performance of the economic system. This
   paper extends the Schumpeterian multisector growth model with vertical
   innovation by highlighting a link between the degree of `targetness' of
   public research and aggregate innovation. A positive effect of social
   capital is also proved.}},

Abstract = {{Given the importance of contextual influences on the diffusion of
   innovations, the theories and methodologies that take context into
   account are increasingly relevant to research and practice. One such
   approach, the systems of innovation approach, considers context to be a
   cascading set of effects arising from various participants and
   innovations surrounding the production and diffusion of a focal
   innovation. Based on this approach, we focus on a public program
   involved in the diffusion of e-business systems to small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). E-business systems are complex
   innovations, and the contextual influences are particularly important
   here, because SMEs often lack the knowledge and resources to
   strategically adopt, modify, and use these innovations. Using the
   systems of innovation approach, we examined the contexts around public
   program interventions with an SME in order to explain their form and
   influence on e-business adoption processes. The empirical findings
   suggest that many public programs fail to effectively deliver
   interventions because program contexts restrict program personnel's
   ability to completely assess and respond to the range of adopter needs.
   While some aspects of the program contexts can be altered by the program
   directors, others are further removed and are currently beyond our
   collective control at this point-in-time. The implications for diffusion
   research and practice are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of farmer participatory approaches over the past
   decades has to some extent improved the relevance and uptake of research
   results. While R\&D prioritization increasingly involves more
   stakeholders, including the private sector, policymakers and civil
   society, building ecological literacy among all stakeholders is urgent,
   especially for sustainable agricultural development. A case study of an
   emerging fruit innovation system in Guinea, West Africa, highlights the
   challenges of supply- and demand-driven approaches to R\&D
   prioritization. Shallow ecological knowledge and a blind faith in
   `modern' technologies by scientists and farmers alike distort
   prioritization. Locally available, appropriate technologies are
   dismissed in favour of high technologies that are inaccessible to most
   smallholder growers. Strengthening the ecological literacy of all
   stakeholders may help to overcome this bias. On the other hand, building
   socio-technological literacy would allow innovation intermediaries, who
   typically act as brokers between the demand- and supply-side of
   technologies, to better understand the social and institutional contexts
   of technologies and how these affect potential uptake by poor farmers.
   Member centres; of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural

   outputs are exported for further processing and distribution to final
   consumers. The Saskatoon-centred, canola-based biotechnology cluster
   exhibits many of these attributes. The majority of the basic research
   and many of the proprietary technologies are imported, assembled into

Abstract = {{Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) is characterized by its

   systems of innovation, this paper introduces the notion of national
   system of AMT and describes the systematic procedure to develop the
   national AMT policy. In doing that, hierarchical classification schemes
   are proposed as the building block for stepwise policy formulation. It
   is highlighted that the criteria of classification schemes differ
   considerably and, consequently, different policy implications are drawn
   depending on the position in the national system. A three-stage policy
   making process is suggested in which industrial system, technology

Pages = {{941-969}},
Abstract = {{The literature on `exit' and `voice' countries (Anglo-American versus
   continental European economies and Japan) points to performance
   differences between these two generic systems of innovation. However,
   little has been done so far to study differences among voice countries.
   This paper suggests that four `voice' countries, Austria, Finland, the
   Netherlands, and Germany, with stable long-term trust relations between
   economic actors and a relatively consensual style of decision making,
   show substantial differences in innovative performance. I argue that
   this is due to both sector specialization and the institutional
   environment. This is because the capacity to escape from historical
   patterns of industrial specialization depends in part on the set of
   institutions in a country. They provide important resources for
   innovation, such as capital and skilled personnel. Indirectly,
   innovations are affected by the system of economic governance, which is
   more or less corporatist in these four countries. However, a corporatist
   regime can be responsive or rigid, depending on the degree of exposure
   to external challenges and crises (regime effect). Furthermore, the same
   responsive or rigid regime can result in different types of innovation,
   depending on whether firms have to operate in a competitive, highly
   exposed sector or in a sheltered one (sector exposure effect). The first
   tentative empirical results show that the regime effect dominates over
   the sector exposure effect.}},

   render the consolidation of the construct more difficult - which its
   characteristics, bound-aries and relation with other, to some extent

   clarify concepts, to identify trends and research opportunities, we
   conducted a systematic literature review from 1993 to 2016, with a
   hybrid methodology including bibliometric and content analysis. Besides
   highlighting the most influential papers and exhaustively discussing the
   innovation ecosystem concept and its variations, we identify a turning
   point in the literature, the transition from business ecosystem to
   innovation ecosystem. Business ecosys-tem relates mainly to value
   capture, while innovation ecosystem relates mainly to value creation. We
   conclude by describing six research streams in innovation ecosystem:

   40(10):1970-1991, 2015) and that there is a need to apply case specific
   metrics. To address this criticism we have taken Brown et al's Res
   Technol Manag 31(4):11-15, (1988) R\&D lifecycle of inputs, in-process
   activities, outputs and impact at micro level to examine what are the
   common and context specific key performance indicators of UIC. Taking a
   qualitative approach and using university-industry collaborative
   projects set in Finland and Russia our study identified a common set of
   micro level KPIs across the UIC lifecycle at a micro level. Namely, the
   amount of resources allocated by partners to collaboration; efficiency
   of collaboration management and clearly defined roles; as well as a
   number of company innovations resulting from collaboration with a
   university and new strategic partnerships. Our study also found
   contextual micro level KPIs as number of young researchers involved, fit
   between collaboration and organizational strategy; number of joint
   publications; enterprise image improvements. Our research extends the
   existing knowledge on UIC KPIs in the following ways. First, we define
   those KPIs, which are applicable by all the three actors of the triple
   helix, but also identify those that are not used by some of these
   actors. Second, we analyse the relevance of certain KPIs proposed by
   governmental bodies and the literature in terms of their applicability
   in the analysed case studies. Finally, we define those metrics, which
   among other existing KPIs depend on the case context (region, research
   area, industrial sector and partners' goals) as well as identify
   additional KPIs, which have not received attention in UIC literature.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the EU and several of its member states have adopted
   strategies in support of a renewable resource-based bioeconomy. It is
   promoted as a promising means of making economic processes and products
   more sustainable, with expected contributions to a range of policy aims.
   However, by increasing the demand for bio-based resources, bioeconomy
   concepts also impose additional pressures on ecosystems. In limiting
   these pressures, innovations regarding the use of biogenic and
   non-biogenic renewable resources play an important role. A
   well-developed innovation system for the bioeconomy must enable immature
   renewable resource-based technologies to progress down the learning
   curve, to eventually reach competitiveness with fossil resource
   substitutes; second, innovation efforts need to be steered towards
   bioeconomy pathways with favourable environmental characteristics;
   third, innovations need to be socially acceptable. Focussing on the case
   of the German wood-based bioeconomy, this contribution examines the role
   that policies can play in shaping such an innovation system. First, we
   review what policy contributions are considered as key for strengthening
   transition-oriented innovation systems in the innovation economics and
   innovation systems literature. We then apply these insights to the
   analysis of the case study's innovation system, to identify systemic
   weaknesses and discuss policy implications. Notably, the transition
   towards a bioeconomy is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty
   and complexity, making the design of demand-pull policies particularly
   challenging. We conclude with policy recommendations for strengthening a
   sustainability-oriented innovation system for the German wood-based
   bioeconomy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Driverless cars with artificial intelligence (AI) and automated
   supermarkets run by collaborative robots (cobots) working without human
   supervision have sparked off new debates: what will be the impacts of
   extreme automation, turbocharged by the Internet of Things (IoT), AI,
   and the Industry 4.0, on Big Data and omics implementation science? The
   IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2)
   miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging
   from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI
   and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0
   is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the
   IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until
   ``everything is connected to everything else{''} poses, however,
   vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly
   integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total
   network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for
   example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated
   systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political
   power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian
   governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or
   through her/his connected surrogates. We propose in this study, Industry
   5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building
   on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT,
   but differs from predecessor automation systems by having
   three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a
   built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected
   entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are
   orthogonalin that they allow ``digital detox{''} by employing pathways
   unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic
   patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical
   information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of
   innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next
   generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global
   governance of emerging technologies: ``Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation
   Research{''} (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology
   opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology),
   independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology
   policymaking. Industry 5.0 is poised to harness extreme automation and
   Big Data with safety, innovative technology policy, and responsible
   implementation science, enabled by 3D symmetry in innovation ecosystem
   design.}},

Abstract = {{New technologies must be accompanied by institutional change. Innovative
   actors therefore need to do institutional work or take a role as an
   institutional entrepreneur in order to shape the institutions in the

   goal of this paper is to bridge these two bodies of literature to gain
   additional insights into how institutional change evolves in a
   technological innovation system. We show how the pharmaceutical firm
   Roche acted as a powerful institutional entrepreneur by influencing the
   health-care system in England to create a market for the personalized
   cancer drug Herceptin. We demonstrate that institutional change can be
   preceded by a range of innovation system-building activities that are
   not directly intended to bring about institutional change but are
   required in order for institutional change to take place. Through this
   case study, we show how the system-building and institutional change

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the diversity of goals and values amongst 26
   Brazilian commercial-scale beef farmers previously identified as
   exhibiting progressive technology adoption behaviours, and considers the
   implications for the agricultural innovation system (AIS). Following the
   Q-methodology guidelines, four main sets of goals and values were
   identified and labelled: the Professional Farmer (PF), the Committed
   Environmentalist (CE), the Profit Maximiser (PM) and the Aspirant Top
   Farmer (ATF). All farmer types believed in operating the farm as a
   business and agreed with the notion that cattle production and nature
   conservation are compatible. The PF aimed to run the farm
   professionally, based on sound technical and managerial practices. The
   CE put a particularly strong emphasis on the long-term sustainability of
   the farming system. The PM focused on technical issues to pursue
   economic returns and efficiency, thereby also creating space for
   lifestyle objectives. The ATF sought physical farm and livestock
   excellence, was growth oriented, and sought recognition by peers. These
   four typologies have implications for the farmers' technology adoption
   and its promotion, e.g. they are likely to influence the uptake of
   particular types of innovations, and reinforce the importance of
   considering AIS within a social systems framework. This is the first
   Q-methodology study to demonstrate considerable diversity of values and
   goals within a subset of technology-adopting progressive farmers, with
   implications within agricultural innovation systems for the integration
   of goal diversity and adoption theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Small-sized and medium-sized contractors are characterized by
   organizational structures that are highly focused on control. As a
   result, employees concentrate on day-to-day activities with little time
   or motivation to generate creative ideas. Generally, the technological
   improvements of these companies arise as a result of problem-solving at
   the construction site. Nevertheless, the actual status quo is changing.
   Some Spanish public agencies are already considering innovation as an
   added value in public procurement; thus, large contractors are starting
   to systemize their innovative efforts. This means that small-sized and
   medium-sized enterprises must modify their attitudes towards innovation
   in order to sustain their competitiveness. The implementation of a
   system that enhances innovation and acquisition of knowledge may be the
   solution to overcome this disadvantage. The implementation of an
   innovation management system was analyzed in a Spanish construction firm
   of medium size for 9 years. The system builds on a set of processes
   aimed to generate innovation projects that allow the contractor to
   document the innovation, not only for internal purposes related to
   knowledge management, but also for external ones associated with
   obtaining better results in public tenders. These processes are as
   follows: (1)technology watch, (2)creativity, (3)planning and executing
   innovation projects, (4)technology transfer, and (5)protection of
   results. The final step is the feedback of the entire process through
   the assessment of the final outcomes. The implementation of the
   innovation system is ensured within the organization, through training
   of personnel, participation of stakeholders, and encouragement of the

Abstract = {{Spending on innovation increased annually in the 2000s in Russia's

   the current climate of sanctions between Russia and Western countries

   need to analyse the factors influencing regional innovation. Previous
   empirical studies using a knowledge production function approach have
   found that the main factor of growth in regional innovation is
   increasing spending on research and development (R\&D).
   Our econometric analyses show that the quality of human capital, a
   product of the number of economically active urban citizens with a
   higher education (the so-called creative class) has the greatest
   influence on the number of potentially commercializable patents.
   Other significant factors were buying equipment, which indicates a high
   rate of wear and tear of Russian machinery, and spending on basic
   research. The `centre-periphery' structure of Russia's innovation system
   favours the migration of highly qualified researchers to leading
   regions, which weakens the potential of the `donor regions'. However, at
   the same time, we see significantly fewer limitations on knowledge
   spillovers in the form of patents and - in this case - proximity to the

Abstract = {{The South Korea's innovation system has been transformed in tandem with
   rapid economic growth over the last three decades. In order to explore
   the evolution process of the innovation system in Korea, this study
   examines the trends and patterns in collaboration activities among the
   triple helix actors, such as university, industry, and government (UIG),
   using co-patent data. The triple helix framework is employed to analyze
   innovation dynamics within the networks of the bi- and trilateral
   relations embedded in patent collaborations. The analyses focus on how
   the triple helix dynamics have been shaped and transformed in the course
   of development of the innovation system. The results reveal that
   collaboration activities among UIG largely increased across three
   developmental phases from 1980 to 2012. In the early periods, strategic
   R\&D alliances between industry and government sector were set up to
   strengthen enterprises' innovation capabilities. When the Korean large
   conglomerates, Chaebols, became a dominant driver of domestic innovation
   activities, the primary agents of the collaborations shifted from
   industry-government to industry-university. The network analysis shows
   that university-industry collaboration is the strongest within the
   triple helix in recent years, followed by industry-government relations
   and then UIG relations. The tripartite collaboration has emerged with
   the rise of entrepreneur universities, but its network has rather been
   weak and inactive. While Korea has experienced a transition from statist
   model to a triple helix, the full-fledged triple helix model has not
   been established yet.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the precision farming (PF) literature on innovation activities, it
   becomes apparent that only individual aspects of the entire PF
   innovation process chain are considered, namely, the knowledge transfer
   and the adoption of PF applications. Therefore, this study seeks to
   analyze the innovation mechanisms in the entire PF innovation process
   chain. The paper identifies potentials, barriers and challenges for PF
   innovations in Germany and the respective agricultural subsector plant
   production. An in-depth understanding of innovation mechanisms is
   required to enhance innovation capabilities, overcome obstacles and
   bring further innovations to the agricultural field. A mix of
   qualitative and quantitative methods was applied-including interviews,
   an expert workshop and a Delphi survey-to explore innovation mechanisms
   and the role of heterogeneous actors. The research is based on the
   analytical framework of the sectoral innovation system approach. Key
   results are the identification of barriers in the later stages of the
   innovation processes (including validation, serial production and
   adoption), a gap in the knowledge transfer between science and practice,
   insufficient communication and co-operation between actors and the
   important influence of political and legal conditions. Furthermore, this
   study showed that farmers play an important role in the generation of
   innovations. For example, farmers are not only adopters or demanders but
   also impulse providers or co-developers. In conclusion, this study moves
   the PF innovation debate forward not only by providing adoption facts

Abstract = {{Evolutionary theorizing conceptualizes the discovery of new products as
   a successful outcome from searching for innovation in which firms
   combine new and old knowledge and resources. Prior research has shown
   that the propensity for discovering new products is greatest when firms
   cross a technological and/or organizational boundary in the search for
   new knowledge. In this paper, we add a new dimension to this literature:
   we examine whether, and to what extent, crossing a national boundary, as
   when firms use knowledge from network partners in foreign countries,
   influences the likelihood that firms will introduce new products into
   the market. Drawing on theorizing on institutional arbitrage in the
   literature on national innovation systems (NIS) and varieties of
   capitalism (VOC), we propose that companies that cross a national
   boundary in searching for innovation are significantly more likely to
   introduce new products. Detailed survey data on firms; data on their
   network partners, including their location; and regression analysis show
   that the use of knowledge from actors in foreign NIS has a positive
   influence on product innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Norway has built up a remarkable solar photovoltaic (PV) industry over
   the last 15 years with central industrial players such as the Renewable
   Energy Corporation Group and Elkem. Norwegian companies are mainly
   active in manufacturing materials for solar cells, but also other
   elements of the value chain for solar PVs, such as manufacturing of
   solar cells, recycling of silicone and of solar cells have become a
   business target. Analyses of industry and innovation dynamics in
   renewable energy technology have been dominated by the technological
   innovation systems (TISs) approach. This paper seeks to complement
   existing TIS analyses by drawing explicitly on the regional innovation
   system approach to analyse the spatially differentiated development of
   solar PV industry in Norway. The historical account of the Norwegian PV
   industry and network analyses of its knowledge dynamics display a marked
   spatial pattern of both intra- and inter-regional industrial
   development. With its origin in Oslo-based Elkem, an industrial
   branching process took place which partly reinforced the Oslo region as
   a localized cluster for the PV industry and partly initiated the
   built-up of industrial activities in other regions. The latter process
   illustrates how PV industry emergence drew on knowledge spillovers from
   incumbent process industries through related variety. In contrast, the
   former drew to a great extent on urbanization advantages because of the
   regional knowledge infrastructure in and around Oslo. While this spatial
   unevenness perhaps has facilitated the built-up of industry, it also
   poses considerable limitations and challenges in the longer term.}},

Abstract = {{Bibliographic databases are frequently used and analysed for the purpose
   of assessing the capacity and performance of individual researchers or

   science is reflected in many theoretical concepts, ranging from
   innovation system theories to territorial cluster concepts and learning
   regions. This article makes use of the extensive information found in
   bibliographic data and assesses the reliability of this information as a
   proxy indicator for the spatial dimension of scientific collaboration in
   emerging economies. This is undertaken using the example of the emerging
   field of biotechnology in China from 2000 onwards. Two data sets have
   been prepared: (1) the frequently used ISI Web of Knowledge database
   (SCI-Expanded) and (2) the domestic Chinese Chongqing VIP database. Both
   data sources were analysed using a variety of bibliometric and network
   scientific methods. The structural and topological similarity of
   networks, built from co-authorship data, is apparent between the two
   databases. At an abstract level, general network forces are present,
   resulting in similar network sizes, clustering, or assortativity.

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{93B}},

Pages = {{105-119}},
Abstract = {{According to the theory of conventions, food value chains (FVCs) involve
   a complex array of actors who share an agreement about the qualities
   embodied in their particular foodstuff. Nevertheless, that agreement is
   continuously challenged by changes in consumer markets. Therefore, I
   argue that FVCs able to adapt those qualities to new trends will perform
   better than FVCs whose commitment to certain qualities leads to a
   misunderstanding between producers and consumers. The organization of
   the chain itself, the values of national regulatory frameworks, and the
   goals of the national innovation system are discussed as factors that
   shape an FVCs' ability to re-arrange that core agreement. By using
   professional reports, statistical records and personal interviews, this
   article focuses on two FVCs that have experienced contrasting
   trajectories in recent decades in the Spanish market: the wine industry
   located in the region of Castile and Leon (Spain) and the Norwegian
   salted cod industry. The growing wine FVC has achieved a successful
   agreement about a set of qualities linked to nature, tradition, and
   place, all of them guaranteed by the reputation of the Designation of
   Origin (DO) system. In contrast, the salted cod FVC is losing its market
   share because its main actors are failing to properly communicate the
   key qualities of environmental sustainability and artisanal cod
   production to concerned Spanish consumers, as well as in the adoption of
   the place-related attributes that still shape consumer preferences in

Pages = {{579-585}},
Abstract = {{A robust supply chain is critical to ensure a sustainable supply of
   feedstock to the existing and emerging bioenergy and bioproducts
   industries. Logging contractors are a key group in this process, since
   they provide harvesting and transportation services, and their success
   is directly linked to innovation activities. Surprisingly, very little
   is known about the innovation system in the logging industry-especially
   about how it relates to biomass supply. Failure to understand how
   logging contractors adopt and implement biomass production technologies
   could lead to failed innovation efforts, unmet development goals, and a
   lack of properly equipped contractors. This article presents results
   from a series of case studies of highly innovative logging contractors
   in Maine. All of the firms had some experience producing biomass within
   their operations. The firms had also used multiple biomass harvesting
   technologies. This study highlights the variation in challenges that led
   to the adoption (or rejection) of biomass as a product innovation with
   particular emphasis on harvesting technologies. A major finding of this
   study was the need for a high degree of collaboration between
   landowners, logging contractors, and biomass consuming facilities in the
   innovation process. The future development of the biomass industry is
   highly dependent on contractors adopting biomass harvesting and related
   technologies. The innovation process of logging firms is an area that is
   not sufficiently studied, and this research provides valuable insight
   into this important component of the forest biomass industry.}},

Abstract = {{Internationalization in R\&D is further growing; it is changing its
   geographical balance, as it is shifting somewhat to the Far East, and
   its nature, increasing the global quest for talent and good research
   conditions as well as for low cost R\&D. This paper focuses on the
   European perspective, i.e. it discusses current challenges Europe faces
   vis-a-vis trends in industrial R\&D, but the findings and arguments are
   more general ones. It argues that our perspective on
   internationalization is still shaped too much by a zero sum-rationale,
   whereby one location wins R\&D capacity that another location loses. It
   develops a cost-benefit matrix in order to capture the overall costs and
   benefits of international R\&D activities more broadly. The paper argues
   that more creativity is needed, that our perspective needs to be
   broadened to tackle all variables conditioning international activities
   in R\&D ( including local conditions of demand and discourse) and to
   stress the importance of the absorption of global knowledge by as many
   actors within an innovation system as possible. On the basis of recent
   survey data the paper furthermore concludes that public research should
   be thought of as a trans-national transmission belt of knowledge and as
   the prime factor that shapes the attractiveness and effectiveness of a
   location for business R\&D. Finally, it is argued that policy schemes
   geared towards international R\&D need to accept and tackle the issue of
   co-ordination of governance and to take advantage of the flexible
   possibilities offered at the European level, beyond the logic of the

   2005) production figure of the crops showed that land under plantain and
   banana production increased by 24.6\% while yield reduction of 21.8\%
   was recorded during the same period ( FAOSTAT, 2006). This abysmal trend
   prompted a 40 years ( 1967 - 2006) review of policy acts and initiatives
   on the crops, with an examination of various efforts in the areas of
   research, dissemination, utilization, production and marketing. Seven
   gaps of critical implications to production and commercialization were
   identified; these include government nonintervention, marketing and
   constraints to production, weak/ fragile links among stakeholders,
   research-farmers dichotomy, project sustainability, lack of
   documentation and funding. Linkages among stakeholders were generally
   weak and without cohesion, objectives were at variance and unhealthy.
   The study concluded that stakeholder's cohesion and coordination of
   efforts is needed for increased production and commercialization. Also
   governmental intervention is needed in the areas of policy initiatives
   and acts that will go beyond the ad-hoc response which are usually
   triggered by natural disaster such as pest and diseases as is the case
   with black Sigatoka outbreak in mid 80's which was the only period
   government really intervened in plantain and banana production in
   Nigeria.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of convergence and cohesion between the European regions,
   the promotion of innovation in regions that are in different phases of
   development has been a central objective of European regional policy.
   For this purpose, the European Commission has launched many innovation
   schemes and many European regions have conducted initiatives of this
   kind. In this article, based on the implementation of successive
   European regional innovation projects in three Objective I regions in
   Greece, namely Central Macedonia, Western Macedonia and Thessaly, the
   trajectory and the changes that have occurred in their system of
   innovation are examined. At the outset, considering the outcomes of the
   first phase of the RTP/RIS exercise, the obstacles in forming these
   regions' dynamic innovation systems are identified. Thereafter, upon the
   outcomes of the follow-up exercise of RIS + projects, an imminent change
   in these regions is observed, highlighting the marking of an
   innovation-oriented policy addressed to create a supporting
   institutional framework and shaping the regional innovation environment.
   Based on these observations, it is argued that European regional policy,

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the impact of globalization processes on models of

   activity, on the one hand, and on national systems of innovation, on the

   globalization of R\&D and its impact on HRM. Drawing on the practices of
   multinationals in four sectors (pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computer
   hardware and software), the paper examines whether the hold of national
   differences in the area of HRM has been significantly weakened in the
   face of new models of competitiveness and management in multinationals.
   It focuses on two dimensions: recruitment and mobility. The studies
   highlight two major trends. The `internationalization' of R\&D clearly
   has effects on HRM models but not as great as might be expected. HRM
   policies such as recruitment and pay systems continue to be nationally
   based, reflecting legal and institutional differences. At the same time,
   in conjunction with new forms of R\&D organization such as projects, the
   standardization of HRM tools may be observed. But this is partial and
   affects only a limited number of tools, notably individual evaluation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{3851-3863}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{The shift from a fossil-based to a bio-based economy (bioeconomy)
   requires more efficient utilization of the biomass generated from
   agricultural production. This can be achieved through the cascading use
   of biomass, which also offers the potential of creating additional value
   from biomass by developing novel products. Taking sugarcane as a case
   study example, this paper aims to analyze how well Brazil, the world's
   leader in sugarcane production, is positioned to reach these goals. The
   paper combines two conceptual tools: one is the `biomass-based value
   web', which was developed as an extension of the value chain concept
   with the aim to capture the links within and between value chains that
   arise from the cascading and joined use of biomass. The other concept is
   that of the `national innovation system' (NIS), which serves to identify
   the different types of actors involved in the biomass value web and the
   linkages between them. For empirical data collection, the study combined
   three methods: a mapping of the physical biomass flows in the value web,
   in-depth interviews with the actors involved, and the application of the
   `Net-Map' tool to identify the actors in the NIS and their linkages. The
   findings show that the development of Brazil's international
   competitiveness in sugar and ethanol was based on political incentives
   that resulted in a strong network of institutions that focused on these
   two products. However, to become a front-runner in the future
   bioeconomy, the existing innovation network needs to be expanded. In
   particular, it is important to integrate national and international
   private sector organizations. The findings also suggest that industries
   need stronger incentives to collaborate with knowledge institutions.
   Long-term consistent policies and funding opportunities for risky
   investments are also required to further strengthen Brazil's innovation
   network to meet future opportunities and challenges of the bioeconomy.

Abstract = {{Since it embarked on its economic opening and reform path in the late
   1970s, the Chinese government has assigned a central role to science,
   technology and innovation for the country's economic development. In the
   phase of `economic catch-up', China has pursued a top-down innovation
   policy, characterized by targeted investments in science and technology.
   Recently, a significant shift in China's innovation policy can be
   discerned, with government increasingly acknowledging the importance of
   markets, private enterprises and favorable institutional conditions as
   determinants of a well-functioning innovation system. This shift is
   concurrent with the realization that the transition from middle-to
   high-income country, and hence the avoidance of the `middle income'
   trap, might require different innovation policies than in the past. In
   this article, we analyze and assess China's initial innovation policy as
   well as its emerging reorientation. Finally, we identify some remaining

Abstract = {{The evolutionary turn in economic geography has shed new light on
   historically contingent regional preconditions for innovation and
   economic growth, which has the potential of improving the analytical
   input to regional innovation system approaches. Evolutionary economic
   geography has renewed interest in and sharpened the conceptual lens on
   firms, their organizational routines and knowledge bases as well as the
   long-term, self-sustaining development dynamics, which may arise from
   their co-location in regions. At the same, it has been pointed out that
   an overreliance on imported evolutionary frameworks (such as Nelson and
   Winter's theory of the firm and their lack of an explicit social
   ontology) may lead to a `theoretical relegation' of institutions and
   agency. It seems also that the policy agenda of evolutionary economic
   geography has remained largely implicit. In comparison, regional
   innovation system has been developed in closer interaction with
   policy-makers and has been used widely as a framework for the design,
   implementation and evaluation of regional innovation policies in a
   variety of countries and regions. The purpose of this article is to
   critically investigate what evolutionary economic geography brings to
   the policy table, and how this potentially can advance a regional
   innovation systems approach. The article specially focuses on how this

Abstract = {{Eco-innovation has been analysed from a variety of perspectives in
   different disciplines. However, there is a shortage of studies at a
   microeconomic level, especially from a management and strategic
   perspective. A gap has been identified in the literature for
   comprehensive, in-depth qualitative analyses of the dynamics of
   eco-innovation which take into account different firms and sectors
   (particularly service industry, where there is a lack of studies), in
   order to contribute to theory-building, considering simultaneously
   different levels of analysis (macro, meso and micro) and different types
   of agents who collaborate in the eco-innovation process. The key aim of
   this paper is therefore to create a strategic model of eco-innovation in
   order to identify and understand how and why eco-innovations are
   developed. A theoretical and empirical approach is provided by examining
   a set of eco-innovative cases from organisations in an advanced European
   region. To this end, a multiple-case study has been designed taking into
   account those gaps identified by the literature.
   An analytical model adapted from classical SWOT analysis has been used
   as a tool to obtain information on the eco-innovation process for the
   purposes of standardising the collection of evidence from the cases
   studied. A diagnosis of external and internal factors aligned with the
   organisation's philosophy and culture allows the strategic axes of
   eco-innovation to be established. The critical factors tend to be:
   environmental concern and regulation; knowledge and technological
   development, networking, and collaboration (external); and knowledge,
   resources and skills (internal).
   The strategic model contains some valuable features (it is integrating,
   holistic and dynamic) and provides additional knowledge of the
   eco-innovation process in a specific context, a regional ecosystem that
   plays a significant role in generating and disseminating eco-innovation.
   It also shows that the regional eco-innovation ecosystem appears to
   react by reaching outside its own confines and interacting with others
   to form a community of ecosystems.
   This model can be used to understand the particularities of
   eco-innovation in other regions, industrial sectors or even ecosystems.
   The main result of this paper, therefore, is the development of a
   transferable model of sustainable and innovative solutions in a specific
   regional context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The social and political perspectives are important considerations for

Abstract = {{The relational resource-based view posits that performance differences

   different sets of knowledge partners are related to each other and

   gap, this study focuses on how technological resources acquired from one
   set of partners (licensing foreign technologies) may generate subsequent
   internal and relational rents in terms of technological innovation in
   the context of collaboration with an entirely different set of knowledge

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{What makes a ``smart region{''} smarter? We argue that it is the active
   orchestration of the regional ecosystem around concepts such as
   knowledge co-creation and exploitation, opportunity exploration, and
   capacity building. Simply adding to the proliferation of software
   developers in the area, stimulating the activities of business clusters
   around information technology, and providing digitally enabled services
   for citizens is not enough to make a region smarter. Smartness is
   enhanced by a well-orchestrated regional innovation ecosystem with a
   strong ``smart specialization strategy{''} that leverages the new
   societal roles played by universities. In this article, we describe the
   European Commission's program for research and innovation strategies for
   smart specialization (RIS3) and show how the Helsinki Region in Finland
   is using smart specialization, ecosystem orchestration, and the active
   role of universities to enhance regional innovation and the
   ``smartness{''} of the region. These activities are discussed in the
   context of policy documents and strategy papers from regional, national,
   and European authorities, which illustrates some differences between
   papers and practice. This is work in progress, and based on early

   system perspective}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{55-65}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In order to address societal demands (e.g., animal welfare,
   traceability, environmental aspects), animal monitoring (AM)
   technologies provide much potential for innovation in animal production.
   AM means the real time and on-going automatic monitoring by `smart'
   sensors of physiological, growth and behaviour parameters of individual
   farming animals, integrated in various areas (e.g., animal milking,
   feeding, breeding, health). The literature on AM mainly focusses on
   technologies and their application. The available information about
   innovation processes in AM is still very fragmentary and not
   comprehensive. The present article analyses the generation, development
   and use of AM technologies in Germany from a dynamic innovation system
   perspective. The analytical framework of the article is based on the
   sectoral innovation system approach. Qualitative interviews, an expert
   workshop, and a Delphi survey were conducted to explore the roles and
   interactions of heterogeneous actors in innovation processes and the
   interlocking between innovation stages. On the basis of identified
   fostering and inhibiting factors, opportunities for systemic
   interventions are suggested to further innovations in AM and in the
   German animal production sector and in other countries. These
   interventions consider, on the one hand, recommendations to support AM
   technologies and their broader implementation Chard skill
   interventions') and, on the other hand, interventions that are suitable
   to stimulate innovations in animal production without specific focus on
   a single technological regime or innovation area ('soft skill
   interventions'). The `hard skill interventions' refer to the need for
   improvements concerning system compatibility and data exchange; the
   special need for financial support of extensive validation of AM
   technologies and clear communication of benefits or constraints to
   farmers. `Soft skill interventions' are related to innovation capacity
   building of actors in order to coordinate co-development processes and
   to improve communication: Finding of a common understanding of the
   innovation system and common language among actors; early involvement of
   all actors and the reflection of actors' roles; resource-based fostering
   of network management Finally, innovation policies should be capable to
   gather and react appropriately to these requirements. Generally, the
   study contributes to a better understanding of the complexity of
   innovation activities in AM and their embedding in the innovation system
   of animal production. The opportunities for systemic intervention can be
   used by the sector's actors to enhance the innovativeness of the German
   sector and to make better use of AM potentials to address the global
   challenges and societal demands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE INFORMATION SUR LES SCIENCES SOCIALES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{While the Triple Helix relationship between university, industry and
   government, called innovation in innovation' by Etzkowitz, has
   frequently been a key concept guiding national and regional innovation
   policies around the world, there is an emerging awareness that no
   one-size-fits-all approach can be used in developing innovation systems.
   Criticism has been expressed that the conceptualization of the Triple
   Helix model in the most recent literature pays little attention to
   contextual effects. The present article seeks to enhance the context
   sensitivity of the Triple Helix model by integrating it with the
   insights of institutional logics. More specifically, seven ideal'
   institutional logics aligned with ideal' Triple Helix activities in
   Western society are identified. These have a potential to be used as a
   conceptual/benchmarking framework for understanding how institutional
   settings, particularly institutional logics, influence the development
   of Triple Helix innovation systems in different national contexts. To
   verify such a proposition, some alternative Triple Helix models as well
   as associated institutional logics are compared to the ideal-type,
   demonstrating that different institutional logics may divert the Triple
   Helix interactions in other directions. Meanwhile, it is claimed that
   institutional logics do not necessarily lead to a Triple Helix model but
   serve only as enabling conditions. To what extent the Triple Helix will
   be developed depends on innovation policies and on the key actors
   involved in the innovation process. The framework constructed in this
   study aims to provide a solid basis from which policymakers, especially
   those from developing and transition countries, may improve the design
   of these innovation policies by employing appropriate Triple Helix
   approaches.}},

Pages = {{47-59}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Novel technologies often face difficulties in market uptake, especially
   when they differ significantly from already established technologies. In
   some cases, like personalized medicine, new technologies are composed of
   a number of parallel emerging technologies - in our case therapeutics
   and corresponding diagnostics - that are heavily co-dependent and cannot
   diffuse without each other. Therefore, actors in an innovation system
   need to engage themselves in complex system building strategies in order
   to create a more favorable environment for their emerging technologies.
   The bodies of literature on system building and innovation ecosystems
   have little overlap so far. In this article, we show how system building
   in a technological innovation system depends on different framework
   conditions in creating a market for personalized cancer therapeutics and
   corresponding companion diagnostics in England such as technological
   complementarities, timing strategies and organizational complexity.
   Using this case we illustrate how notions from the literature on
   innovation ecosystems can complement the current system building

   Innovation in UK universities}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{471+}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding
   of what Open Innovation means within university context. Focus is also
   put on the role universities believe they should play in Open
   Innovation, as well as the changes that might have arisen as a
   consequence of universities' greater awareness of this concept.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology used is an
   exploratory study based on in-depth semi-structured interviews of
   Pro-Vice-Chancellors (or equivalent level) of a variety of British
   universities. The study was designed around five main research themes:
   discourse, change, strategy, management, Open Innovation success.
   Findings - In addition to the traditional teaching, research and
   knowledge transfer roles of university, this study has uncovered a new
   role of universities: trusted intermediary (or ``Open Innovation
   Hub{''}). Another key finding of this study is that it highlights the
   diversity that prevails in the UK with regard to Open Innovation.
   Research limitations/implications - The number of the interviews
   conducted for this study is probably not large enough to allow a solid
   generalisation. Data saturation, however, was achieved in this study.
   The insight provided by this study is particularly significant as
   interviewees were amongst the highest-ranking executives in their
   respective universities. Hence the views reported in this study are what
   ``drives{''} Open Innovation policies in the universities that
   participated in this study.
   Practical implications - This new role of a trusted intermediary played
   by universities is very likely to change the existing Open Innovation
   landscape and re-shape policies.
   Social implications - The changing role of universities within Open
   Innovation context may potentially change the respective role of other
   stakeholders in the Open Innovation ecosystem.
   Originality/value - This is the first study aimed at investigating how
   British universities understand Open Innovation and what opportunities
   and challenges they associate with this process.}},

Abstract = {{In the Netherlands green gas is seen as a sustainable alternative to
   natural gas. However, green gas is still not competitive to natural gas
   in terms of pricing, and production volumes are remarkably low.
   Currently, there is a lot of attention to green gas which stems from
   upgraded biogas, which is produced by manure-based anaerobic
   co-digestion by livestock farmers. In this article the central question
   is to understand green gas demonstration projects from stakeholders'
   perspectives, and identify barriers accordingly. The results of our
   analysis show that a disproportionate burden lies with biogas producers,
   who are therefore unwilling to invest. In large part this is due to
   juridical-administrative stipulations that provide gas grid operators
   with little incentives to invest, notably in biogas infrastructure and
   biogas treatment equipment. However, biogas producers face many more
   risks and challenges: (production) subsidies not being granted, legal
   permits to operate biogas plants not being granted, limitative
   environmental policies that restrict business operations, and price
   instability regarding co-feedstock. Moreover, access to bank to loans
   has declined strongly in recent years. Altogether, the risks potential
   biogas producers face, the lack of regulatory incentives grid operators
   have to engage in green gas business development, and the lack of market
   demand among end consumers, do not favor green gas niche development.
   This can only change when policy makers design stakeholder specific
   strategies to solve those barriers; e.g. public investments funds to
   cover for high upfront costs, and regulatory changes regarding the role
   and competences of grid operators.}},

Abstract = {{The UK energy technology innovation system (ETIS) has undergone

   review. Within an international trend to ETIS rebuilding, UK experience
   has been distinctive: from a low starting base in the early-2000s, to
   system remaking under a strong decarbonisation policy imperative in the
   late-2000s, to multiple and contested drivers in the early-2010s. Public
   funding levels have been erratic, with a rapid increase and a more
   recent decline. The private business sector has played a leading role in
   this remaking, and as this influence has grown, the role and style of
   energy innovation has shifted from long term niches to the shorter term
   mainstream. The UK ETIS suffers from persistent problems: fragmentation,
   low transparency and weak links to the research evidence base. (C) 2014

   SPs. This finding supports the notion that SPs can play a positive role

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Transfer of low carbon technologies to developing countries has been
   recognized as important in global efforts to limit climate change. Yet
   the mechanics of international technology transfer, especially around
   intellectual property rights, have remained a controversial issue in
   international negotiations. Using a new dataset on international
   partnerships in China and India in three key low carbon technologies
   solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, and coal gasification/integrated
   gasification combined cycle and complementary expert interviews we study
   the dynamics of the transfer of intellectual property and the underlying
   drivers that guide the development of business strategies and
   partnerships in the context of transitioning intellectual property
   regimes in emerging markets. We find that weak intellectual property
   regimes are indeed a hindrance to the diffusion of certain classes of
   low carbon technologies: (i) for cutting-edge technologies, (ii) for
   fully-embodied (explicitly codified) technologies, and (iii) for small
   firms. However, we also find that intellectual property issues do not
   represent a barrier to the diffusion of the relatively mature and low to
   medium cost low carbon technologies that are materially (at scale) most
   important for carbon dioxide emissions reduction in the short to medium
   term. Competitive technology supply, shifting market dynamics, and
   increasingly vigorous domestic innovation coupled with mechanisms and
   opportunities to structure credible intellectual property deals allow
   for the diffusion of key low carbon technologies to occur within the
   context of existing business, political, and institutional structures.

   a solar photovoltaic manufacturing base. We ask whether the DCR of the
   NSM will be effective in ensuring the global competitiveness of the
   beneficiary sector. Our analysis reveals three observations that
   indicate this outcome is unlikely: (1) the manufacturing base has become
   less competitive over time, (2) developers may be favoring thin-film
   technology, thereby bypassing the DCR, which applies specifically to
   crystalline silicon cells and modules and (3) gaps in the Indian
   innovation system are likely to prevent a return to competitiveness by
   solar photovoltaic manufacturers. In particular, a comparison with the
   Chinese innovation system indicates shortcomings in the Indian
   innovation system of R\&D capabilities, coordination of resource
   provision and complementary industrial strengths. Given these
   observations, we suggest that policymakers remove the solar photovoltaic
   DCR from the NSM. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of future food production in South Asia generally agree
   that the conditions for production will radically change in the years to
   come, in particular due to climate change and market variations.
   However, because we do not know how conditions will be modified and what
   adaptations will be required by farmers, the article assumes that
   innovative farming systems will cope best with changes, whatever those
   changes turn out to be. The challenge, then, is to identify
   circumstances that either promote or hamper innovation. A comparative
   analysis of 2 farming communities in the Himalayas concludes that no
   single parameter can explain the observed variation of agricultural
   innovation. Rather than restricting analyses to ``innovation systems{''}
   that consist of social institutions only, the article proposes an
   approach that includes social actors, as well as natural resources, in
   processes that produce ``innovative places.{''} In this study, water
   availability, farm size, and an active national nongovernmental
   organization are parameters that encourage innovation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{66-75}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{For a regional port necessarily involved in global supply chains, the
   development of its hinterland region is critical to its long term
   sustainability. Such development can be fostered by a regional
   innovation system (RIS), although the risks of path dependency and
   lock-in may lead to a region decaying. A process for contributing to a
   RIS is the Regional Development Platform Model (RDPM), the focus of this
   paper. As a new approach to regional development, the RDPM is utilised
   and adapted to identify opportunities for potential development in a
   region. In this paper, the RDPM is linked to the role of a port
   authority and its potential to drive regional growth centred on its
   innovation network. Port authorities, by assuming the role of network
   leader, can shape the regional innovation network and create new
   development trajectories through their links to various levels of
   government and the wide range of stakeholders that utilise the port
   facilities. The inherent tensions in this role and the competing
   possibilities of path creation and path dependence to create value for a
   wide network of stakeholders are challenging.
   The paper investigates the use of the RDPM and how port authorities can
   influence development strategies for mutual benefit in this context.
   More specifically, a case study of the Burnie Port in Tasmania,
   Australia is conducted by utilising desktop research, interviews, an
   expert panel and industry roundtable to demonstrate that the RDPM has
   the potential as an approach beyond analysing the main sources of path
   dependency in a local region. By following the adaptation of the RDPM,
   it is argued that the trajectory of path dependency can be interrupted,
   for example by a port authority, enabling the potential for new paths to
   be created. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a large and growing effort in the evaluation of public R\&D
   funding programmes, we know surprisingly little about their long-term
   effects. This is a pity, because the conventional justifications for
   state intervention in research depend upon phenomena such as the
   production and use of public goods, knowledge, spillovers, the
   production of human capital, and systemic changes that are inherently
   long term in nature. The few available long-term studies demonstrate
   that the time constants involved are indeed very big. However, the way
   public policy is governed and managed pushes us to evaluate in the short
   term: trying to explain or somehow to `measure' the effects of
   programmes that may not be complete and whose effects may not even be
   expected until some time in the future. An earlier article considered
   what the existing evaluation record tells us about Framework Programme
   performance, pointing out the short-term orientation of the evaluation
   techniques used and the correspondingly limited perspective they provide
   on impacts. This article reports newer work to explore longer term
   effects and emphasizes the role of the Framework Programme in
   coordinating the development of the European innovation system. Thus
   while traditional studies of long-term effects of research emphasize the
   links between new knowledge and innovation, a more systemic approach
   points to the role of funding not only in these aspects but also in the
   social shaping of the research and innovation system.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation has become the driving force for competitiveness in the
   knowledge economies in Europe and in the world as well. Contemporary
   approach to innovation is based on the systems approach as innovation is
   not created in isolation but in an interaction of various actors and is
   dependent on the environment in which innovating subjects exist. The
   approach distinguishes between national, regional and sectoral systems
   of innovation which are formed by all participants who create and spread
   innovation at the corresponding level, main groups being knowledge
   providers (e.g. universities and research institutions) and knowledge
   users (firms). For innovation management the national, regional and
   sectoral innovation strategies have been developed in many countries and
   regions including also the level of OECD and European Union. In the
   paper the systems approach to innovation is explained and the main
   strategies to innovation in selected countries outlined. The aim of the
   paper is to analyze the state of art of these strategies in Central
   European countries known as Visegrad Four (V4) countries in the
   framework of EU development strategy Europe 2020. The main innovation
   and research indicators by which the innovation performance of countries
   is measured are defined, evaluated and compared and the results of

Abstract = {{The dynamic economic development of Guangdong Province is one of the
   most prominent examples of China's catch-up in the course of the past
   two decades. Once chosen as the nation's first experimental field for
   the market economy, the province continued to participate above average
   in national economic growth ever since. At present, it still maintains a
   leading position with regard to general industrial performance and
   average personal income. However, as China's industry begins to embark
   on a path to technological upgrading, this pre-eminent position begins
   to be challenged. In the nation's emerging fields of strength, the
   province's rivals, Beijing and Shanghai, are in a better starting
   position because they are better endowed with both R\&D capacities and
   qualified human capital.
   In this context, our paper illustrates the resulting challenges through

   continuously impressive export performance in the high-tech sectors,
   Guangdong is far from being well prepared to maintain its current

Abstract = {{A sustainable and dynamic approach to agricultural development has
   remained of great concern to the government and priority for discourse
   in the policy arena. Past efforts have concentrated on investment in
   research and development which was established on the consensus that the
   application of science and technology is responsible for the structural
   transformation required to propel the agricultural sector. Public
   research and extension institutions are projected as the sole source of
   innovation/knowledge requisite to trigger development in the
   agricultural sector. Several other relevant macro economic and meso
   level factors such as policy and legislative framework and nature of
   human capital, physical infrastructure, finance and investment climate
   and system for facilitating information and knowledge flows were not
   considered as important. The emerging reforms and changes in knowledge
   structure of agriculture explicitly indicate that the traditional
   agricultural research and extension system alone cannot sufficiently
   address the challenges of the new trends. Innovation system approach
   offers a holistic and, multi-disciplinary approach to innovation and
   processes, incorporating emerging reforms and approaches for
   agricultural development. This paper concludes that government, policy
   makers, and administrators should invest and promote researches in
   sectors/sub sectors of economic and food security importance, using this
   analytical framework. Government should encourage and facilitate farmer
   and private sector innovative strength by enacting favourable polices
   (patenting and reward system) that will act as incentives. Institutional
   context of any innovation should be sufficiently analyzed by policy
   makers as requisite to promoting such innovation, while extension
   workers should build such information in technology packages to farmers.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of the literature on networking has brought to the fore the
   advantages of proximity between actors in spatially confined enclaves

   transaction cost minimisation and knowledge exchange advantages,
   networking in these special enclaves leads to higher firm performance.
   Seen therefore as a core dynamic of the regional economic process,
   networking is an important tool of regional and industrial policy at
   both the EU and Irish levels. Globalisation, which reaches its paroxysm
   in the case of a small and open economy such as Ireland, raises the
   relevance of geographical proximity as an important element in
   networking. This article addresses this topical issue by using a
   descriptive analysis drawn from a survey of 126 firms from three
   industries carried out in 2005 in the Shannon region of Ireland. One key
   finding is that networking, defined as material linkages, is more likely
   to involve firms in the international market than firms at lower
   geographical levels. Also, networking is influenced by certain firm

Abstract = {{The implementation of Lean Thinking in innovation management has not
   been executed systematically yet. For instance high uncertainties of
   processes or limited possibilities for automation in research and
   development (R\&D) indicate special requirements for the implementation
   of Lean Thinking. A competitive R\&D requires a holistic rethinking for
   the implementation of Lean Thinking.
   The Lean Innovation System represents the systematic interpretation of
   Lean Thinking principles regarding to product or process innovation and
   development. One core element of Lean Innovation is the Value System
   which is the basis for the value stream design in innovation and
   development projects. The Value System defines, structures and
   prioritises `values' adaptively for one specific innovation project. The
   values are defined by all relevant stakeholders in the innovation and
   development process, like external and internal customers, considering
   company's strategy and culture. It represents the basis for a consequent
   value oriented alignment of project and processes in R\&D.
   This paper introduces Lean Innovation and the core findings of the
   recent survey `Lean Innovation' of the Laboratory for Machine Tools and
   Production Engineering WZL at RWTH Aachen University. In a next step the
   paper focuses on the Value System, describes its elements and shows how
   to use and benefit from the Value System towards a powerful Lean

   can be used to restrict the commercial activities of competitors,
   patents have gotten the appropriate scrutiny to ensure their validity.
   At the same time, we need to accept that the PTO will still make
   mistakes, and create a judicial system that deals with those mistakes in
   a balanced way. Doing this without an infeasible increase in resources
   for the Patent Office will require that the system be significantly
   modified. The modifications should be carefully tuned to create
   incentives so that private parties have the incentive and opportunity to
   bring information to bear, but have limited incentive and opportunity to
   act simply to gum up the works.}},

Abstract = {{China, since the beginning of its `open door' policy, has done much to
   reform its National Innovation System, recognising that its ambitious
   agenda for science and technology could only delivered by a focus on the
   regional. In 1988 China's first science park, by far the largest in
   Asia, was created at Zhongguancun Science Park (ZSP) near Beijing. ZSP
   was established following visits by Chinese scientists to Route 128 and
   Silicon Valley in the USA, and the importation of perceived best
   practice to China. ZSP is analysed as a Regional Innovation System,
   comprising high-technology firms and institutional infrastructure within
   five clusters. This approach highlights the interactions and knowledge
   flows between the elements of the system. The five clusters comprise:
   high technology entrepreneurs/enterprises, institutions, support
   endowments, government and intermediaries clusters, each of which is
   made up of a number of elements. ZSP closely interacts with China's NIS,
   some national R\&D laboratories and a number of national universities
   located within the science park.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose that historically generated institutions and

   systems of innovation in Africa. These factors determine the development
   path of the region. We advance the notion of dynamic and non-dynamic
   systems of innovation, the latter describing the African condition. We
   combine the strands of literature on institutions and their persistence
   in shaping development with evolutionary theory and systems of
   innovation. Evidence is presented on the colonial origins of skewed
   schooling enrolment, at variance with the industrialization objective of
   modem economies. Employing simple statistical tests, the persistence of
   initial human capital (school enrolment) reflects in the significant
   correlation among the three levels of schooling enrolments, and
   correlation of enrolment in 1970 with per capita income in 2000, a
   periodicity of some three decades. This outcome is consistent with the
   literature on countries at early stages of development. Path-dependency
   is partially proved even though we did not attempt to investigate all
   variables making up the system of innovation. This is a first tentative
   attempt to explore long-run development in Africa within the systems of
   innovation framework.}},

Abstract = {{The different sectors of the economy, and the forest sector in
   particular, must create innovations in order to survive and to be
   competitive. Scientific knowledge should be introduced and
   institutionalized into the forest processes, but also knowledge derived
   from other sources such as user producer relationships and others should
   be incorporated. A new concept is emerging that considers that the
   economy should learn not only from the new scientific knowledge but also
   from the rest of the processes. This concept is National Systems of
   Innovation (created in 1985 in the Scandinavian countries), however,
   here the concept is broadened of a Sustainable System of Innovation.
   This approach of sustainable systems of innovation (SSI), considers that
   the sources for innovation towards development, particularly sustainable
   development, are formal organisations (universities, research centres,
   or so), the productive structure (the economy). the institutional set-up
   (patterns of behaviour), the economy-ecology relationships (potential
   and limitations of the ecosystem for production) and the policies of the
   sector. Each one of these factors interact and feed each other. They
   cannot be seen independently nor static; on the contrary, they are
   dynamic and evolutionary, without any doubt including the ecosystem.
   Then, the process of learning from all these sources, which is the base
   for SSI, may produce `greener' innovations, greener technologies and
   greener institutions. Innovations related to forest services from Costa
   Rica will illustrate these ideas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper locates impact assessment research within the disciplinary
   constructs of agricultural economics, the institutions (rules of the
   game) and organizations (structures governed by these rules/norms) of
   agricultural innovation. The paper analyses the disciplinary limitations
   in impact assessment research. In the hard science culture of
   agricultural research the social sciences, closer to the reality of
   complex technological contexts, are less prestigious. Agricultural
   economics, the disciplinary root of impact assessment, imposes a major
   constraint by making institutional contexts and variations intractable
   and analysed at best as disturbances. Sophisticated econometric
   methodologies substitute for information on institutions, systems
   components and relationships. The paper presents an analytical framework
   to distinguish between the institutional and organizational variables in
   the agricultural innovation system. The case study of institutional and
   organizational change in Indian agricultural research and extension is
   used to demonstrate the role of institutions in determining the impact
   of agricultural science and technology. Impact assessment research is
   institutionally conditioned to took for end point consequences of
   research, such as yield increase, cost reduction, or farm income. This
   body of knowledge ignores crucial requirements such as the institutional
   framework (hierarchy for instance) and actors that facilitate these end
   point impacts. Mainstream impact assessment literature is not concerned
   about the important relationships among these institutions and actors,
   or about the impact of knowledge on these institutions and
   organizations. In the quest for end point consequences, estimated often
   as rates of return to investment, impact assessment has overlooked
   important requirements and relationships within agricultural innovation
   systems. An analysis of institutional learning using the key elements of
   an evaluation culture as proposed by program evaluators is used to
   demonstrate the need for impact assessment to engage with institutional
   questions and build the capacity for institutional learning. There is a
   felt need to move from impact assessment to a larger evaluation culture.
   Agricultural research evaluation has much to learn from regular program
   evaluation. This calls for more social science research besides
   neoclassical agricultural economics, and active interaction among the
   natural and social scientists, extensionists, farming communities,
   policy makers and other actors. Effective evaluation in general and
   impact assessment in particular depends on the institutional learning
   capacity of the actors, especially scientists and policy makers. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes recent data on the ``globalization{''} of industrial
   R\&D, emphasizing that the patterns of international R\&D investments
   differ significantly among industries, and seem to differ among
   different activities within the innovation process. I distinguish among
   the creation of new technologies (often identified with invention), the
   development of these inventions into commercially attractive products,
   and the production and marketing of these new products. None of these
   activities is well measured within industrial economies, and our
   measures of their international dimensions are even less reliable, The
   available evidence on trends in each of these three activities suggests
   that the most significant increases in ``internationalization{''} have
   taken place in the exploitation of new technologies, largely as a
   by-product of increased crossborder direct investment in production
   activities. But at least some evidence indicates that much of the
   technology creation activities of large firms remains concentrated in
   their home economies.
   Nevertheless, the structure of activity in technology development and
   exploitation resembles the pattern of trade in industrial manufactured
   products-increased specialization in specific technologies or innovative
   activities that relies on a supportive national infrastructure and
   innovation system, combined with declining costs of communication and
   crossnational investment. As a result, intrafirm and interfirm networks
   for the support of innovation are developing rapidly throughout the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a hypothesis stating that at the initial stage of
   growth by a latecomer, increased participation in the global value chain
   (GVC) is necessary to learn foreign knowledge and production skills,
   that functional upgrading at middle-income stage requires effort to seek
   separation and independence from existing foreign-dominated GVCs, and
   that latecomer firms and economies might have to seek reintegration back
   into the GVC after establishing their own local value chains. This paper
   aims to verify this ``in-out-in-again'' hypothesis by looking into firm
   cases of upgrading in Korea and Brazil. Trends in the share of foreign
   value-added in gross exports (FVA) in successful catching-up economies
   of Korea and Taiwan, including China recently, are consistent with this
   pattern. Regression results also confirm a negative correlation between
   the degree of local creation and diffusion of knowledge and FVA values,
   such that gaining increased local knowledge is a basis for increasing
   (reducing) domestic value-added (foreign value-added). Given that this
   variable of local creation and diffusion of knowledge is a key
   innovation system variable, this finding implies that building local
   innovation systems is the key in making a possible upgrade while being
   integrated into the GVC.}},

   (IoT) which will potentially connect billions or even trillions of edge
   devices which could generate huge amount of data at a very high speed
   and some of the applications may require very low latency. The
   traditional cloud infrastructure will run into a series of difficulties
   due to centralized computation, storage, and networking in a small
   number of datacenters, and due to the relative long distance between the
   edge devices and the remote datacenters. To tackle this challenge, edge
   cloud and edge computing seem to be a promising possibility which
   provides resources closer to the resource-poor edge IoT devices and
   potentially can nurture a new IoT innovation ecosystem. Such prospect is
   enabled by a series of emerging technologies, including network function
   virtualization and software defined networking. In this survey paper, we
   investigate the key rationale, the state-of-the-art efforts, the key
   enabling technologies and research topics, and typical IoT applications
   benefiting from edge cloud. We aim to draw an overall picture of both
   ongoing research efforts and future possible research directions through
   comprehensive discussions.}},

Title = {{Lock-in of mature innovation systems: the transformation toward clean

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{155}},

Abstract = {{Energy-intensive processing industries like the concrete industry form
   the base of the economy and account for a large part of global
   greenhouse gas emissions. Sectoral transformation to cleaner basic
   materials is therefore crucial, and institutional pressure to do so is
   increasing. However, socio-technical studies have not sufficiently
   addressed these sectors. This paper therefore sets out to analyze the
   systemic problems that inhibit the transformation of the mature
   innovation system of the concrete sector toward the development and
   diffusion of clean concrete innovations, for the case of the
   Netherlands. A structural-functional approach has been frequently
   applied to identify such systemic problems, but has been limited to
   emerging technological innovation systems. Consequently, the approach
   tends to overlook the systemic lock-in that arises from closed cycles of
   interdependent systemic problems and vested interests that characterize
   mature innovation systems and that hamper system transformation. This
   paper analyzes these characteristics to extend the application of the
   structural-functional approach to the transformation of mature
   innovation systems. Interviews with 28 stakeholders were conducted and
   triangulated with reports, websites and other documents. A list of
   systemic problems was identified that originate within actors,
   institutions, networks, technology and infrastructure and that impaired
   the performance of all system functions except knowledge development.
   Systemic problems are indeed found to be sustained through systemic
   lock-in, i.e. closed cycles of interdependent systemic problems. Through
   strategic, often collective action, established firms with vested
   interests were able to reinforce these interdependent systemic problems
   to inhibit clean concrete innovation. The study concludes that systemic
   lock-in inhibits the sustainability transformation of the mature
   innovation system of concrete in the Netherlands and confirms that the
   application of the structural-functional approach can be extended from
   emerging to mature innovation systems. Overcoming systemic lock-in
   requires a series of well coordinated policy measures that should be
   implemented in a specific order, to prevent reverting back to the lock
   -in around the original system configuration. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{During the past few decades, the configurations of new
   knowledge-intensive environments have required fertile settings for
   innovative and entrepreneurial activities. In these environments, Triple
   Helix has been operationalized in different ways, spaces, and contexts
   where those agents are transforming their roles in the development and
   strengthening of national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystems. As
   a consequence, the phenomenon of entrepreneurial innovations emerged
   from enterprises with an entrepreneurial or high-growth orientation that
   collaborate with Triple Helix agents generating economic benefits and
   spillover effects. In emerging economies, the available literature about
   innovation and entrepreneurship is limited to explore the determinants
   of innovation performance as well as innovation constrains. Based on
   this argument and diverging from prior research, this research tries to
   provide a better understanding about the influence of Triple Helix
   agents on entrepreneurial innovations' performance of enterprises
   located in emerging economies. In particular, we analyze the effects
   produced by the links of enterprises with other enterprises,
   universities and government on their innovation performance (e.g.,
   access to knowledge/technology, sources of funding, government
   subsidies), as well as, the moderation effects generated when those
   enterprises have a high-growth orientation (e.g., distinction of
   enterprises that develop entrepreneurial innovations or traditional
   innovations). To achieve this aim we look inside at the case of Mexico
   because is an emerging economy that during the last two decades has
   facing a transition to a knowledge-based economy. Using a cross-section
   dataset of 19,188 Mexican enterprises interviewed in the period of 2006
   to 2012, we tested our proposed conceptual model with a Tobit
   regression. Our study provides interesting implications for the main
   actors involved in the Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation
   System, as well as, contributes about the debate of the impact of
   enterprises-university-government linkages on entrepreneurial
   innovations from diverse perspectives and research fields (e.g., open
   innovation, knowledge transfer, high-growth entrepreneurship, academic
   entrepreneurship, public entrepreneurship). (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The transition from fossil fuel-based energy systems to renewable energy
   systems is a cornerstone of the green transformation to decarbonize our
   economic systems and mitigate climate change. Given the urgency of
   effective climate change mitigation, renewable energy diffusion needs to
   accelerate drastically. Among the many constraints to renewable energy
   diffusion, the important role of the supply chain is often overlooked.
   Therefore, this article addresses the role of the supply chain in the
   renewable energy diffusion process. Using the offshore wind energy
   sector as a case, this article presents an analysis of supply chain
   readiness to ascertain the role of the supply chain in the green
   transformation. Examining Europe and China mainly within offshore wind
   logistics, the research findings show that this segment of the supply
   chain constitutes a key bottleneck for accelerated deployment. For
   Europe, the key findings indicate that legislation for offshore wind
   beyond 2020 is necessary to ensure the implementation of the required
   investments in logistics assets, transport equipment, and personnel. In
   China, the key findings indicate that the Chinese supply chain of wind
   energy is mainly organized around onshore wind. Key bottlenecks exist,
   predominantly in logistics, and this article identifies specific areas
   of the supply chain where international collaboration and knowledge

Title = {{What Is a Complex Innovation System?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Innovation systems are sometimes referred to as complex systems,
   something that is intuitively understood but poorly defined. A complex
   system dynamically evolves in non-linear ways giving it unique
   properties that distinguish it from other systems. In particular, a
   common signature of complex systems is scale-invariant emergent
   properties. A scale-invariant property can be identified because it is
   solely described by a power law function, f(x) = kx(alpha), where the
   exponent, a, is a measure of scale-invariance. The focus of this paper
   is to describe and illustrate that innovation systems have properties of
   a complex adaptive system. In particular scale-invariant emergent
   properties indicative of their complex nature that can be quantified and
   used to inform public policy. The global research system is an example
   of an innovation system. Peer-reviewed publications containing knowledge
   are a characteristic output. Citations or references to these articles
   are an indirect measure of the impact the knowledge has on the research
   community. Peer-reviewed papers indexed in Scopus and in the Web of
   Science were used as data sources to produce measures of sizes and
   impact. These measures are used to illustrate how scale-invariant
   properties can be identified and quantified. It is demonstrated that the
   distribution of impact has a reasonable likelihood of being
   scale-invariant with scaling exponents that tended toward a value of
   less than 3.0 with the passage of time and decreasing group sizes.
   Scale-invariant correlations are shown between the evolution of impact
   and size with time and between field impact and sizes at points in time.
   The recursive or self-similar nature of scale-invariance suggests that
   any smaller innovation system within the global research system is
   likely to be complex with scale-invariant properties too.}},

Abstract = {{Most research on innovation management at the organizational level has

   holistic, hands-on concept currently lacking in the open innovation
   approach. From the conceptualization, a framework for analysis is put
   forward which provides structure to the study of ongoing and finished
   innovation processes. Additionally, the development of the OIS is a
   first step in the development of a currently underdeveloped micro-level

Abstract = {{This paper discusses some aspects of innovation in China. As China seeks

   Our starting point is the Needham Puzzle - the paradox that while China

   the Industrial Revolution happened in Europe rather than in China.
   Potential explanations for the Needham Puzzle may shed light on the

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The design, management and evaluation of foresight is challenging
   firstly due to the vast diversity of foresight practices and secondly
   due to its embeddedness in the context of other policy processes. To
   help overcome these challenges we look at the contributions of foresight
   from multiple perspectives in a systemic way and propose the concept of
   multilayered foresight, which analyses the contributions of foresight to
   knowledge, relations and capabilities on four layers: landscape, system,
   organisation and individual. We construct these layers building on
   earlier literature and illustrate them with a case example from the
   region of Antofagasta in Chile. We argue that foresight exercises
   benefit from considering multiple levels and respective different
   emphases in analysis. For instance, on the landscape layer the focus
   tends to be on contributions to knowledge while on the organisational
   layer it is more on capabilities. The layers help position the foresight
   exercise and its effects in relation to the broader context. Thus, we
   expect the concept of multilayered foresight to support the design,
   management and evaluation of foresight. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Efficiency measurement has been receiving significant attention the last
   years especially after the recent economic crises and the need of
   efficient use of public money. Although single step efficiency
   measurement is usually applied, taking into account the internal
   structure of the system is expected to provide more meaningful and
   informative results. This could be done in two axes: decomposition of
   the process into sub-processes and hierarchical modeling among system
   components. In this framework we extend the Data Envelopment Analysis
   approach by examining efficiency through multi-level and multi-stage
   modeling. The proposed modeling approach (1) can give a better insight
   in sub-processes compared to single-stage ones and (2) can take into
   account functional/systemic characteristics (e.g., a Decision Making
   Unit operating as a part of a greater system). Through a `soft'
   integration approach, not only different stages can be introduced but
   also hierarchies can be easily accommodated. Analysis of the efficiency
   of national/regional innovation systems is used as an illustrative
   example. The innovation process is modeled as a multi-stage process

   multi-level one, where regional innovation is achieved within a national

Abstract = {{The current momentum in the electrification of the car fuels hope for a

   analytically, a theoretical framework is developed: the concepts of
   transformative capacity of a new technology (do electric vehicles
   trigger social innovations, e.g. new business models or use patterns?)
   and system adaptability (how stable is the mobility regime?) are
   introduced and the issue of sustainability is discussed. This framework
   will be explored for the German innovation system for e-mobility. It can

Abstract = {{The present article considers the cultural and historical background and
   genesis of the research education concept from the perspective of the
   knowledge society development. Ideas and educational practices linking
   educational activities and research studies both in the higher and
   secondary schools are presented. It is stated that research education is
   becoming a mission not only of a specific university but also of a
   specific school. Such education requires the successive cognitive
   development of a personality. In this connection, there occurs the
   process of forming educational partnerships of schools, universities and
   research organizations. Examples of educational activities in Russia,
   the United States, and Western Europe are given. The conclusion has been
   made that at the end of the 20th century there appears an educational
   institution of a research type - the University and school - which uses
   the cognition methods inherent in a scientific search, is
   institutionalized in cluster-network forms and is based upon an
   educational innovation system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Strong international partnerships are a key vehicle for building an
   efficient national innovation system. Successful global cooperation
   needs comprehensive knowledge of the features of the science and
   technology (S\&T) sphere in a changing environment of global division of
   labour, competition, and political climates. New realities and trends
   emerge, changing the established `rules of the game' and calling for
   immediate actions from politicians, experts, and various economic
   actors.
   The authors propose an analytical approach to build and examine an
   empirical database. Drawing on bibliometric analysis and expert survey
   tools, such an approach helps allows identifying the most promising
   areas for Russia's international S\&T cooperation. The authors assess
   the scope for applying the proposed methodology. Based on the latest
   available data in Web of Science, the international scientific citation
   indexing service (2014 and early 2015), they compare the structure and
   variation over time of scientific specializations in Russia, leading
   S\&T countries, and several rapidly growing global economies.
   The cooperation priorities that were identified via matrix analysis were
   complemented with data from expert surveys. The surveys highlighted the
   partner organizations, thematic areas, and instruments of S\&T
   cooperation, which indicate some of the future possibilities for
   Russia's international S\&T cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates R\&D collaboration between universities and
   firms by looking at R\&D outsourcing of private firms to universities
   and vice versa. It was found that universities are an important research
   partner of private firms, although industrialists often do not trust the
   research capabilities of universities. It is evident that universities
   are accustomed to receiving agents rather than giving agents in R\&D
   activities. This fact implies that a give-and-take culture should be
   cultivated in universities in order to develop university-industry R\&D
   collaboration. It may bring about university-generated cooperative R\&D
   with private firms if universities contract out more of their research
   projects to private firms. The results of our study also revealed that
   government policies to promote university-industry R\&D cooperation have
   been strengthening. Two cases of government policy programmes showed
   that policy targets, especially to promote university-industry R\&D
   collaboration, tend to be included not only in incumbent policy
   programmes but also in newly designed policy programmes. The government
   R\&D budget has been increasingly allocated to specific policy
   programmes focusing on interdisciplinary cooperative R\&D activities

Abstract = {{This paper explores the potential of combining technological innovation
   systems research with a participatory stakeholder dialogue, using
   empirical material from a dialogue on the options of sustainable biomass
   in the Netherlands and several historical studies into the emerging
   Dutch biomass innovation system. These studies identified and analysed
   functions (key processes) needed for the diffusion of this system. Using
   the functions as a heuristic to analyse and present this material, this
   paper shows that combining both approaches results in a richer
   understanding of the Dutch biomass innovation system. Where innovation
   systems research has not inquired in-depth into the normative dimensions
   of biomass innovation, the dialogue contributes to a better
   understanding of these. In contrast to systems research where the
   researcher defines system boundaries, the dialogue allowed system
   boundaries to be defined along the process in a bottom-up manner. This
   resulted in different ideas about challenges and opportunities. Where
   dialogue discussions were based on somewhat anecdotal information,
   biomass innovation systems research provided a historical and systemic
   contextualisation. Furthermore, the functions served as useful
   categories to explore future sustainable biomass options. We conclude
   that triangulation, using both historic and participatory methods,
   provides more insight, in terms of both range and depth, in the actual
   functioning of innovation systems and opportunities for improvement. (C)

Abstract = {{Globalisation and structural and demographic change are presenting
   Japan's economy and many regional economies with major challenges. In
   earlier decades, the international transfer of technology was an
   important factor in Japan's rise to become one of the leading
   industrialised nations. Today, however, the focus is on the
   interregional and intraregional transfer of technology between research
   institutions and private firms when addressing the issue of national and
   regional competitiveness. Regional innovation policies, in particular
   those under the responsibility of the Japanese Ministry of Economy,
   Trade and Industry (METI) and its regional bureaus, have for several
   years been making a great effort to promote the intraregional transfer
   of technology and business start-ups. This paper investigates the
   structure, the spatial reach and the innovation performance of R\&D
   networks that have built up as part of a regional development programme
   financed by METI. A social network analysis is carried out using a
   unique data set of joint research projects of public research
   institutions, private firms and government institutions. The results
   show that the spatial patterns of R\&D networks depend on the technical
   field of the research projects as well as on the role of the parties
   involved. Academia-academia cooperations have a much greater spatial
   reach than cooperations with private firms. The public sector plays an
   important role in local innovation processes.}},

Abstract = {{This special issue reflects on innovation and industrial policy from the
   premise that economic growth can be based on the permanent
   transformation of an economic system via the emergence and/or
   transformation of multi-agent structures and their inherent competences
   and knowledge base. The process of emergence or transformation is
   conceived as being the result of entrepreneurial effort, or
   entrepreneurs reacting to external stimuli in a way that takes advantage
   of an evolving knowledge base. The same process, however, can be
   undermined by both market and institutional failures. Past research has
   clearly indicated the importance of institutional structures for
   innovation, but also that structures as they exist may not be ideal:
   some institutions involved in innovation may provide the wrong
   incentives, faulty information, or allocate insufficient resources to
   accomplish their goals or mandates; and they may fail to reduce
   uncertainty. The paper asks whether and how a targeted, co-evolutionary
   approach can help overcome a lack of dynamic coordination and other
   failures that originate in coincidence with the emergence of a complex
   form of industrial organisation, be it an innovation system, cluster or
   a new industrial sector. More specifically, it builds upon the extended
   industry life cycle (EILC) model and the notion of evolutionary
   targeting to explore the potential benefits (and drawbacks) of targeting

Abstract = {{With the shortage in fossil energy and the increasing demand for
   renewable energy sources, the solar energy, or photovoltaic (PV),
   industry has flourished. The main purpose of this paper is to integrate
   and extend a multiple stakeholder perspective and the National
   Innovation System (NIS) to decipher the convergence and strategic
   dynamics among the innovation networks of the PV industry. Data are
   collected through a survey of multiple stakeholders, including
   government, industry experts, scholars and silicon wafer and solar cell
   firms. Building upon a multiple stakeholder perspective, we identify the
   behaviors of stakeholders and construct a strategic network based on
   their interests in order to understand the evolution and potential
   transition trends of the PV industry. As a result, our empirical studies
   show that the silicon wafer and solar cell industries are highly
   dependent on the silicon supplies of companies abroad, while major
   stakeholders spontaneously converge in non-government stakeholder
   network rather than that in government-led network. The paper
   demonstrates that studying stakeholder networks enables us to identify
   the dynamics and interactions of stakeholders in the development of the
   PV industry. That is, the empirical results not only provide an overview
   of innovation activities within the widely accepted NIS landscape, but
   also identify key success factors influencing the successful development
   of the PV industry. The implications of the study enable us to
   reevaluate the relationship between stakeholders and the NIS with
   respect to the development of industrial innovation policies. Crown

Abstract = {{It is widely acknowledged that the rate of innovations can be enhanced
   through interaction between new constellations of actors, crossing
   borderlines between different mindsets, knowledge and skill bases (e.g.
   Brown and Duguid, Org Sci 2(1):40-57, 1991; Cooke and Morgan, The
   associational economy: firms, regions, and innovation, 1998;
   Leonard-Barton, Wellsprings of knowledge: building and sustaining the
   sources of innovation, 1995, p. 64; Stamm, Managing innovation, design
   and creativity, 2008, p. 335). Studies of economic prosperity have also
   pointed to cooperation and competition between neighboring actors as a
   driver for competitiveness and innovativeness, be it for a company, a
   business area or a region (e.g. Piore and Sabel, The second industrial
   divide: possibilities for prosperity, 1984; Porter, The competitive
   advantage of nations, 1990). The hypothesis behind the geographical
   focus is that geographical proximity between actors promotes interaction
   and hence innovation. In EU, and also in Norway, this has been used
   actively as guidance in national and regional policy, where construction
   of innovation systems such as clusters and interorganizational networks
   are promoted and funded. To get organizations and institutions in a
   region to collaborate more is seen as the panacea for innovation,
   transformation and prosperity. However, companies often treat such
   constructed initiatives as an add-on to their ordinary, often
   long-lasting, business relationships between customers and suppliers
   (HAyenkansson et al., Business in networks, 2009, p. 13). This could
   imply that the necessary anchoring of such new innovation system
   initiatives with the companies' own innovation processes is weak or
   missing. The terminology system points to the importance of the
   different elements (actors) in the system, their interrelatedness and
   their impact on each other (Meadows, Thinking in systems. A primer,
   2009). An innovation system, like a network, cannot deliver innovation
   if the elements (i.e. the companies) of the systems don't respond with
   related actions to the common endeavor. However, the different actors'
   intraorganizational innovation processes are hardly mentioned in the
   innovation systems theories, thus lacking the important system feedback
   link between the intraorganizational innovation processes within the
   single company and the interorganizational innovation processes which
   are taking place in the collaborative initiative. In this article it is
   argued, supported by a case story, that attention to both of these
   processes and the nexus between them is needed in order to construct
   sustainable interorganizational innovation system initiatives. A model
   for this is proposed, based on a dual organization development process,
   encouraging system feedback loops and thereby bridging the single
   participating organization and the interorganizational collaborative
   initiative.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews current challenges in the Australian extension
   environment and provides a case for developing an adaptive extension
   platform for the dairy sector in Australia and New Zealand, to support
   evolving dairy farm systems. The variation in the public-sector
   engagement in extension, the diversity and number of extension providers
   and a relatively uncoordinated approach to define new extension roles,
   functions and professional requirements are current challenges for dairy
   extension across Australia. In the dairy sector, these challenges
   coincide with increasing demand for a responsive research, development,
   extension and education system in supporting the rapid evolution in
   dairy farming systems. Addressing these challenges is not an issue for
   extension alone; however, the required level of integration among
   research, development, extension and education in an environment where
   needs are changing and resources are scarce demands an engaged
   dairy-science profession. Drawing on international extension and
   agricultural innovation-system literature and earlier empirical
   research, the following three areas for development are proposed: (1) a
   professional development strategy that incorporates (i) an understanding
   of the new professional situations extension works within, (ii)
   leadership in cross-industry and cross-sector coordination concerning
   the nature of the changing client in research, development, extension
   and education system and (iii) clear priorities for extension; (2) a
   professional development plan that incorporates a workplace-learning
   approach; and (3) for extension specialists to be engaged in defining
   research priorities, the agenda for change and suitable pathways for
   change alongside other professional groups, including farming. This
   development agenda will, however, require an adaptive extension platform
   to advance these areas on behalf of farmers and public stakeholders.}},

Abstract = {{Health biotechnology has rapidly become vital in helping healthcare
   systems meet the needs of the poor in developing countries. This key
   industry also generates revenue and creates employment opportunities in
   these countries. To successfully develop biotechnology industries in
   developing nations, it is critical to understand and improve the system
   of health innovation, as well as the role of each innovative sector and
   the linkages between the sectors. Countries' science and technology
   capacities can be strengthened only if there are nonlinear linkages and
   strong interrelations among players throughout the innovation process;
   these relationships generate and transfer knowledge related to
   commercialization of the innovative health products. The private sector
   is one of the main actors in healthcare innovation, contributing
   significantly to the development of health biotechnology via knowledge,
   expertise, resources and relationships to translate basic research and
   development into new commercial products and innovative processes. The
   role of the private sector has been increasingly recognized and
   emphasized by governments, agencies and international organizations.
   Many partnerships between the public and private sector have been
   established to leverage the potential of the private sector to produce
   more affordable healthcare products. Several developing countries that
   have been actively involved in health biotechnology are becoming the
   main players in this industry. The aim of this paper is to discuss the
   role of the private sector in health biotechnology development and to
   study its impact on health and economic growth through case studies in
   South Korea, India and Brazil. The paper also discussed the approaches
   by which the private sector can improve the health and economic status
   of the poor. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The commercialization of research has become a key task of universities
   and public research institutions. This development is partly stimulated
   by an increasing number of government support programmes (GSPs) that are
   designed to stimulate academic entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the role
   that is played by this new type of actor in the innovation system is not
   very well understood. We use a principal-agent theory to guide our
   analysis of a Norwegian GSP. The programme contributes to reducing the
   agency problems of adverse selections and moral hazards in the
   relationships between the government and the actors that are involved in
   the commercialization of research. Key tasks include collecting and
   sharing information, engaging in long-term relationships with principals
   and agents, developing strategies and specific contractual
   relationships, taking higher risks for risk-averse agents and using
   multiple indicators. The programme also plays an institutional role by
   reducing goal conflicts. This approach requires a long-term effort that
   is generally less visible for outside stakeholders, and it is under
   constant pressure from short-term expectations.}},

Abstract = {{Faced with the challenge to increase the level of innovation in science
   and technology many societies have developed a national innovation
   system as a form of public policy programs. If innovative culture is
   crucial for the adoption and development of new technologies, it is of
   great importance to explore the concept and possibly find out which type
   of culture is more innovative than others. Presented in the paper are
   the results of the first empirical study of innovation culture in
   Croatia based on a survey on the representative sample of Croatian
   population. Drawing on Hofstede's concept of dimensions of national
   culture, Croatian national innovation culture is operationalized as a
   set of value orientations and norms (uncertainty avoidance,
   individualism, masculinity - femininity, long-term or short-term
   orientation, and power distance). Four scales based on Hofstede's
   dimensions were constructed, which mainly support the content validity
   of his concept. They could be used to measure differences in innovative
   capacity between groups and regions. The analysis shows the presence of
   multiple dimensions of innovation culture in Croatia that might hinder
   innovation capacity, but this doesn't necessary lead to the conclusion
   that we can identify one type culture elements as the only model for
   strengthening the innovative culture.}},

Abstract = {{In many countries in Africa, the twin processes of modern biotechnology

   This paper uses Kenya's biosafety regulatory system for the management

   some insights from the Advocacy Coalition Framework, this politically
   charged subsystem reveals empirically two advocacy coalitions which
   influenced the regulatory decision process trajectory. This has had
   significant implications for emerging regulatory instruments where
   different sources of knowledge informed the process. Thus, any
   innovation system with governance issues should reconceptualise how the
   tacit knowledge emanating from the complex relationships built around
   different advocacy coalitions is managed.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{When compared to the U.S. and Israel, the weak venture capital (VC)
   markets and VC policy in Europe up to the early 2000s stimulated two
   alternative streams of research. A majority view, which we term
   traditional, focuses on the role of VC in overcoming market failure in
   the financing of innovative ventures. The policy recommendations
   emerging from this view involve a mix of monetary incentives and
   institutional changes that can be applied irrespective of the local
   context. The second is an evolutionary perspective on VC and VC policy.
   This is based on a dynamic analysis of the co-evolution between VC and
   high-tech entrepreneurship, as well as an adaptive view of policy and
   policymaking (Metcalfe, Econ J 104(425):931-944, 1994). In this setting,
   policy-makers have to overcome not only market failure but also dynamic
   system failure associated with the linked emergence of entrepreneurial
   high-tech clusters. Overcoming traditional market failure becomes a
   necessary but not sufficient pre-emergence condition for the eventual
   attainment of the latter policy objectives. This paper surveys the
   post-2000 literature on VC and VC policy and criticizes some of its
   assumptions and results. Moreover, it examines the Israeli and
   UK/Scotland innovation policy frameworks from an historical perspective,
   which allows us to highlight differences in approaches and impacts. The
   upshot is that the success of VC policies depends on a number of
   factors, including the phase of emergence of a VC market and high-tech
   cluster and the specific country/region institutional setting.}},

   between national, super-national and sub-national forces it entails in
   the field of technology.
   The concept of technological system (TS) is proposed as a useful
   starting point to analyze the consequences that globalization has for a
   variety of different technological aspects. A taxonomy is then put
   forward to distinguish its implications for those elements of a TS which
   are more related to the state from those which are closer to the idea of
   nation. Interesting results are obtained by allocating the contributions
   of a growing, but not yet conclusive, body of literature to more
   specific technological aspects, such as: `techno-territoriality',
   pertaining to physical distances and spaces, `techno-sovereignty',
   related to governance structures and policy making,
   `techno-citizenship', about strategic behaviors and accountability, and
   `techno-nationality', concerning socio-cultural sharing phenomena. The
   application of this taxonomy shows that globalization has reduced the
   relevance of national (and more local) technological aspects much less
   than is generally maintained. This is particularly true for
   techno-nationality. Indeed, a certain communality of language and
   culture within a country, along with its historically formed
   institutional setting, is an important enabler of the innovative process
   and induces different technological styles and performances.
   `Techno-national systems of innovation' therefore still matter. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{By connecting institutions within industrial evolution, this paper
   develops a set of systems of innovation to explain the innovative
   performance of Taiwan's personal computer industry. Three major
   institutional blocks are identified: technology as a paradigm;
   organizational routines that are historically rooted in the structure of
   economic dominance; and the state's governance as an institution of
   policy style. The paper explores how each of these institutions is
   important for innovation, and then identifies methods associated with
   creating and sustaining innovative performance. The analysis is focused
   at the level of industry segments, that is, one level below sectoral
   analysis. While institutional co-evolution in technology and society
   often results in improved performance of an industry segment,
   institutional conflicts are likely to produce obstacles to the search
   for new markets by national firms as well as hinder adaptation to a
   changing environment. This explains why Taiwan's personal computer
   industry is competitive and innovative in hardware, but lagging in
   distribution and software development. The paper concludes with several
   strategic and policy implications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Spatial networking is the `new normality' of local innovation systems,
   featuring a heterogeneous set of inter-organizational ties and a
   constant circulation of information, knowledge, practices, and other
   intangible assets of actors engaged in the regional innovation milieu.
   Understanding the particularities of territorial communities formed
   clarify the socio-spatial dynamics and the development trajectory of the
   region, its competitiveness and innovative potential. The study explores
   the variety of factors that affect the patterns of these socio-economic
   interactions, such as the networking objectives, the stakeholders
   involved, the benefits projected, their spatial embeddedness, as to
   reduce the equivocality inherent to methodologies of delimitation and
   subsequent demarcation of spatial-network interactions. The study rests
   upon analysis of different types of relations formed between
   heterogeneous actors of regional socio-economic system, both at
   inter-firm and inter-organizational level. Providing a classification of
   major factors that determine the features and patterns of spatial
   networking, the paper proceeds with discussing the differences in their
   dynamic configurations using three scholarly concepts - industrial
   district, business cluster, and global innovation network. The study
   revealed 20 individual typological characteristics in a group of four
   determining features of spatial-network interactions - the stakeholders,
   the linkages, the network, and the context. The typology elaborated is
   irrelative to the types of spatial networking analyzed, thus, being
   equally applicable to the modeling of different configurations of
   entrepreneurial interactions within the regional milieu. Territorial
   capital assessment requires a holistic approach in determining the
   socio-spatial dynamics of the regional milieu. This necessitates
   defragmentation of local ties into value constellations of the single
   regional socio-economic and innovation system. The study contributes to
   the understanding of internal mechanisms of various forms of
   entrepreneurial networking, providing a set of criteria for integrated
   evaluation of spatial-network interactions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel simulation model that shows the dynamic and
   complex nature of the innovation system of vehicle automation in a
   quantitative way. The model simulates the innovation diffusion of
   automated vehicles (AVs) on the long-term. It looks at the system of AVs
   from a functional perspective and therefore categorizes this technology
   into six different levels. Each level is represented by its own fleet
   size, its own technology maturity and its own average purchase price and
   utility. These components form the core of the model. The feedback loops
   between the components form a dynamic behavior that influences the
   diffusion of AVs. The model was applied to the Netherlands both for a
   base and an optimistic scenario (strong political support and technology
   development) named ``AV in-bloom{''}. In these experiments, we found
   that the system is highly uncertain with market penetration varying
   greatly with the scenarios and policies adopted. Having an `AV in bloom'
   eco-system for AVs is connected with a great acceleration of the market
   take-up of high levels of automation. As a policy instrument, a focus on
   more knowledge transfer and the creation of an external fund (e.g.
   private investment funds or European research funds) has shown to be
   most effective to realize a positive innovation diffusion for AVs.
   Providing subsidies may be less effective as these give a short-term
   impulse to a higher market penetration, but will not be able to create a
   higher market surplus for vehicle automation.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests entrepreneurial ecosystems are a potent engine
   for economic and community development. Prior research has identified an
   ecosystem's culture as serving a critical role in its creation and
   functioning. However, it is not clear how the cultural forces in
   entrepreneurial ecosystems develop and are shaped by individuals,
   organizational actors, and ecosystem-level institutions. Drawing from
   institutional theory and theories of multiple logic organizations (i.e.,
   hybrids), this paper combines entrepreneurship and management research
   to argue that entrepreneurial ecosystems are influenced by two dominant
   institutional logics: entrepreneurial-market and community. By combining
   both logics, hybrid support organizations, such as incubators,
   accelerators, and small business development centers, play a unique role
   in entrepreneurial ecosystems by exposing participants to the two
   guiding logics. Furthermore, it is argued that intra-ecosystem variation
   among hybrid support organizations in the dominance of
   entrepreneurial-market and community logics, will result in a diversity
   of entrepreneurship within an ecosystem. This theorizing contributes to
   the understanding of entrepreneurial ecosystems by shedding light on the
   role institutional logics and hybrid support organizations play in
   ecosystem formation, structuring, and function and by explaining the
   genesis of the cultural values that guide ecosystem participants.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Despite the impressive growth of smart city initiatives worldwide, an
   organizational theory of smart city has yet to be developed, and we lack
   models addressing the unprecedented organizational and management
   challenges that emerge in smart city contexts. Traditional models are
   often of little use, because smart cities pursue different goals than
   traditional organizations, are based on networked, cross-boundary
   activity systems, rely on distributed innovation processes, and imply
   adaptive policy-making. Complex combinations of factors may lead to
   vicious or virtuous cycles in smart city initiatives, but we know very
   little about how these factors may be identified and mapped. Based on an
   inductive study of a set of primary and secondary sources, we develop a
   framework for the configurational analysis of smart cities viewed as
   place-specific organizational fields. This framework identifies five key
   dimensions in the configurations of smart city fields; these five
   dimensions are mapped through five sub-frameworks, which can be used
   both separately as well as for an integrated analysis. Our contribution
   is conceived to support longitudinal studies, natural experiments and
   comparative analyses on smart city fields, and to improve our
   understanding of how different combinations of factors affect the
   capability of smart innovations to translate into city resilience,
   sustainability and quality of life. In addition, our results suggest
   that new forms of place-based entrepreneurship constitute the engine
   that allows for the dynamic collaboration between government, citizens
   and research centers in successful smart city organizational fields.}},

Abstract = {{By utilizing only half of its total technical wind energy potential,
   Colombia would be able to supply the entire country's demand for

   wind power, representing about 0.4\% of the total technical potential.
   In this paper, the slow diffusion of wind energy in Colombia is
   analyzed, by evaluating the functions of the Technological Innovation
   System (TIS) along with the influence of the wider context (Landscape
   Factors). A combination of expert evaluations (structured and
   semi-structured interviews) and a history event analysis revealed
   existing weaknesses in the TIS functions and influence from the wider
   context (landscape level). Several factors at the landscape level were
   found to have a significant influence on the TIS functions for wind
   energy in Colombia. Policy recommendations are provided to address
   barriers in order to advance the diffusion of wind energy in Colombia.

Abstract = {{This article explores whether old, incumbent industries can prevent new,

   explanations that have been proposed to account for why Norway failed to

   acquired all available risk capital, (ii) the petroleum industry
   captured all relevant technological expertise and (iii) the government
   failed to provide adequate incentives and support measures. The article
   applies a qualitative event-history analysis to chart the development of
   the most important Norwegian advanced biofuel companies - Borregaard
   (bioethanol), Cambi (biogas), Weyland (bioethanol) and Xynergo
   (biodiesel) - and uses their success and eventual failure as a key
   indicator of the condition of the emerging technological innovation

Abstract = {{Cities are restless systems. Increasing urbanisation and the cumulative
   growth of urban management issues are pressing local governments to
   provide valuable services. Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the
   redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens.
   Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICT5
   involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open
   data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot
   provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to
   establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be
   appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of
   this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and
   standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be
   used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities:
   free and readily available services based on the wealth of information
   `owned' by local governments. Adopting a design science research
   methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called
   UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between
   citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is
   on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations
   and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and
   open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services
   prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city
   government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology has become a crucial
   part of climate change mitigation strategies around the world; yet its
   progress has been slow. Some have criticised CCS as a distracting hype,
   even as mainstream support continues. This article adapts the literature
   on technological hypes to develop a framework suitable for technologies
   with limited media/public exposure, such as CCS. It provides a
   qualitative context and analyses seven quantitative indicators of hype
   that are largely internal to the CCS technology regime. Throughout, the
   article contrasts results for CCS with those of comparable technologies.
   The main findings, which support the view that CCS has been hyped, are
   as follows. ``Expectations{''} mounted rapidly in the form of project
   announcements for electricity applications of CCS and deployment
   forecasts in influential reports. However, announcements soon plummeted.
   ``Commitments{''} remained high, nonetheless, judging by allocations in
   public budgets and number of peer-reviewed publications. Meanwhile,
   ``outcomes{''} in terms of patents, prototypes and estimated costs
   reveal few if any improvements for CCS. Considering these findings and
   the characteristics of CCS, its development is likely to be more
   difficult than initially expected. Accordingly, this article calls for
   decisively prioritising CCS for industrial and, potentially, bioenergy
   uses. Coal- and gas-fired power plants may be replaced by non-CCS
   technologies, so power CCS development is far less pressing. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{When Technology Foresight (TF) began to be adopted in industrial
   countries, it tended to be still somewhat a marginal activity in
   developing countries. Today globalization radically transformed the
   range of economic activities that developing countries can perform.

   flows of knowledge and technology are available, but need to be fully
   employed in the framework of coherent industrial strategies.
   This paper examines how and to which extent TF programs are needed in
   developing countries given the new prevailing global context. It argues
   that the TF and industrial strategy are and must be mutually consistent
   and they need to be taken seriously, coherently designed and implemented
   in light of their role to shape and economic growth. We provide
   preliminary support to this argument by discussing the theoretical

   Regional Studies. The Intermediate Technology Initiative (ITI) was one
   of the most ambitious systemic' regional innovation policy instruments
   developed in the UK in recent years. However, little of the ITI's
   anticipated outputs materialized and the programme was prematurely
   terminated. This paper examines the reasons for its failure, which
   largely centred on the programme's inappropriate design. The findings
   suggest that greater recognition needs to be given to the specificities

   paying greater attention to policy failures could potentially help
   innovation scholars better understand how innovation systems function.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-16}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The growth in popularity of the regional innovation system
   approach has, in part, been driven by the need for economies to respond
   to the after shocks of the global financial crisis. At the same time,
   the author sees the term anchor institutions are used increasingly to
   describe organisations that have an important presence in the local
   community and make some strategic contribution to the local economy. The
   purpose of this paper is to consider the needs of the micro and small
   business (MSB) ecosystem through the lens of the entrepreneurial
   university as a regional anchor institution.
   Design/methodology/approach - Asheim et al. (2011) refers to regional
   innovation systems as, an emphasis on economic and social interaction
   between agents, spanning the public and private sectors to engender and
   diffuse innovation within regions embedded in wider national and global
   systems. According to Doloreux and Parto (2005) three dimensions
   underpin the use of the regional innovation systems concept, namely: the
   interactions between different actors in the innovation process, the
   role of institutions and the use of regional systems analysis to inform
   policy decisions. The author has drawn on contemporary literature on the
   entrepreneurial university, regional systems of innovation and
   institutions to explore some key qualities and problems around anchor
   Institutions, networks and national and local policy.
   Findings - Following the Chancellor's Comprehensive Spending Review in
   November 2015 and post the changes in the Department of Business
   Innovation and Skills remit the author wants to highlight the way
   universities can take a lead role as an anchor institution within their
   region. The author argues that this role should include providing a
   wider range of formal and informal support, knowledge and resource for
   MSBs, alongside the usual SME suspects (Hart and Anyadike-Danes, 2014;
   Witty, 2013; Wilson, 2012). Based on my analysis and involvement in the
   the work of the eight Entrepreneurial Universities of the Year Award
   winners - during the author's time as President of ISBE - He suggested
   four different ways in which collaboration might be enhanced to ensure
   MSBs make maximum use of the advice and support on offer from
   universities playing this anchor role.
   Originality/value - The results emerging from this work suggest a need
   for regional policy makers to embrace a innovation-supportive culture,
   which actually enables firms and systems to evolve over time would be
   far more effective than those proposed in the latest Comprehensive
   Spending Review. The outcomes of which will see some of the most
   robustly evaluated programmes, designed to support small firm growth,
   closed down and replaced by a commitment (by government) to secure a
   strong, growing economy, cutting of more red tape and extending small
   business rate relief for an extra year (Mole, 2015).}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the discovery of giant magneto-resistance (GMR) and its
   development and commercialization by the global disk drive industry to
   answer the question of ``Who captures the benefits from innovation in a
   global innovation system?{''} We assess the returns to the scientists,
   firms, and countries associated with GMR. We find that the French and
   German scientists that discovered GMR and their labs benefited by
   receiving the Nobel Prize and small licensing fees. The firm that first
   commercialized the technology, IBM, captured profits from selling hard
   disk drives and magnetic heads using GMR. Other hard disk drive and head
   manufacturers based in the U.S. and Japan were able to quickly
   assimilate the technology and catch up with IBM. France and Germany
   reaped limited returns due to the lack of domestic firms with the
   absorptive capacity to commercialize GMR. The U.S. and Japan benefited
   from the success of their firms in commercializing GMR, as did other
   countries which were part of the global value chains of those companies.
   Consumers and firms that incorporated hard drives in their products
   ultimately benefited from cheaper hard drives with greater capacity.
   These findings illustrate the importance of absorptive capacity at the
   firm and national level in capturing benefits from innovation. They also
   show that the benefits to first mover firms can be short-lived in a
   competitive industry with open transfer of knowledge and limited
   appropriability regimes. Finally, they show that the location of jobs
   and wages associated with innovative products depends on the structure
   of the global value chains of leading firms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The analytical framework of regional innovation systems highlights the

   historically strong sectors), and fragmentation of actors and

   as well as the institutional framework surrounding them. This paper
   offers a framework for analysing innovation system problems, focusing on
   actors and activities as well as institutions. In doing so, the need for

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the geographical and organizational patterns of
   scientific collaboration, in terms of co-authored scientific articles,
   in the Danish-German border region of Southern Jutland-Schleswig. The
   motivation behind the approach lies in the fact that scientific
   collaboration in border regions, in general, and the studied region, in
   particular, has rarely been discussed in the academic literature. The
   integration model of cross-border regional innovation systems provides
   the conceptual framework for the task. The paper, thus, gives
   methodological insights for the measurement of cross-border integration
   of knowledge infrastructures. The analysis reveals that collaborating
   with partners close but on the opposite side of the border is rare.
   Instead, cross-border collaboration takes place with partners from more
   faraway international research organizations. The reasons behind this
   can be found in the science bases - arguably more than from historic,
   linguistic or ethnic reasons - of the adjacent sides of the border. The
   research fields that the local scientists are engaged in seem to be too
   different between the Danish and German sides of the border region to
   foster large numbers of co-authored publications and, thus, the

Abstract = {{Improving the level of energy efficiency required by building codes for

   energy efficiency in building codes. Existing approaches to the
   evolution of standards focus primarily on adopting individual or
   multiple technologies or products, but only peripherally explore the
   feedback dynamics between innovation, diffusion, and standardization
   (IDS.)(2) To fill this void, I draw on the revelatory case of
   Switzerland, because the Swiss standards have continuously improved
   since 1970, whereas in many other countries improvements have stagnated
   after the recovery from peaks in energy prices. The paper's contribution
   is, first, a qualitative, structural model which endogenously formalizes
   the IDS-dynamics of standard improvement. I find that the co-evolution
   of voluntary and legal building codes have enabled a continuous
   improvement of the standards even in the absence of economic pressures.
   And second, I use the model for policy analysis, which indicates that
   several obvious policies might cause policy resistance and could result
   in uneconomical, counter-intuitive outcomes. Policy interventions have
   to dynamically balance the speed of innovation and the ability of system

Abstract = {{The Triple Helix model of innovation systems is widely diffused. The
   fundamental idea of the model is that `university' can play an enhanced
   role in innovation in knowledge-based societies and that the three
   helices - `university', `industry' and `government' - interact in order
   to produce innovation and therefore regional and national economic
   growth. This is, however, only one model among several different
   systemic approaches for explaining regional differences in
   innovativeness. While the triple helix model emphasizes the role of the
   university for regional innovativeness, the other systemic approaches
   call attention to either industry or government as having the lead role
   in innovation. Further, the triple helix model is developed and
   primarily explored from a macro-level perspective and not from a
   firm-level perspective. Finally, while the theoretical value of triple
   helix interactions are reasonably confirmed, there are still gaps in the
   triple helix concept, and the practical value is only just beginning to
   realize its potential. From a firm-level perspective, the purpose of
   this article is therefore to test the applicability and practical value
   of the triple helix model when exploring the formation and growth of
   firms using the case of Google Inc. Useful when exploring a firm's
   formation and growth, the triple helix model forces the exploration to
   start even before the entrepreneur enters the scene, which provides a
   more holistic picture of firm formation. The three helices were all
   found to play important but changing roles in the different phases of
   firm formation and growth. The Google case contributes further
   understanding of the nature and historical evolution of interactions
   between the three helices, thereby filling some gaps in the triple helix
   concept. The Google case also identifies a number of mechanisms for
   interaction and the important role of the bridging organizations that
   connect the helices and contribute to the development of interactions.
   Finally, the concept of `spaces' proved relevant and useful, although in
   the perspective of a firm, the concept has a broader meaning and exists
   on different levels.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation develops within a diverse group of social entities that form
   an interwoven structure. The role and relations of regional entities
   within clusters have become a critical point of innovation due to the

   In this study, we model such interactions via the Triple Helix
   framework, which can be used to demonstrate the collaborative relations
   of three entities (university, industry, and government) in an
   innovation system. This framework allows this research to diagnose the
   roles and relations of regional innovation institutions and define the
   characteristics of the innovation models for science parks in South
   Korea and Taiwan; subsequently, this research quantitatively measures
   two regional university-industry-government network densities to find
   collaborative knowledge generation. Second, network centrality is
   measured in order to analyse the regional innovation participations'
   roles of collaboration. Finally, the status of cluster performance is
   qualitatively compared and related to collaboration networks. This study
   presents an analysis of the structure and position (qualitatively and

Abstract = {{Several studies have emphasized the role of knowledge-intensive business
   services (KIBS) in fostering innovation in metropolitan areas and
   regional innovation systems. Such areas are capable of expressing a
   strong demand for KIBS and consequently stimulate the rise and growth of
   KIBS. Despite an abundance of literature on KIBS emphasizing the
   relevance of spatial proximity to customers, many KIBS develop
   relationships on a broader national or even international scale. No
   studies have focused explicitly on this apparent discrepancy as yet. The
   aim of this paper is therefore to fill this theoretical and empirical
   gap by explaining the firm-level factors relating to the market
   extension of KIBS within the framework of regional innovation systems.
   Our analysis is based on a quantitative study on more than 150 KIBS
   supplying design or communication services located in the Veneto region
   (north-eastern Italy), an area that can be described as a regional
   innovation system. Five variables were considered, that is, size,
   experience, service standardization, investments in network technologies
   and relational intensity. Our results confirm that three of these
   variables, but not service standardization and relational intensity,
   correlate positively with the market extension of KIBS. Policy
   implications are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{For the last two hundred years, neo-classical economics has recognized
   only two factors of production: labor and capital. But, nowadays
   information and knowledge are replacing capital and energy as the
   primary wealth-creating assets. Technological developments have
   transformed wealth-creating work from physically-based to knowledge
   based. Technology, knowledge as well as innovation are now the key
   factors of production.
   Knowledge economy is economy based on creating, evaluating, and trading
   knowledge. In a knowledge economy, labour costs become progressively
   less important and traditional economic concepts such as scarcity of
   resources and economies of scale of economy cease to apply. The most
   valuable asset of the 21st-century institution, either business or
   non-business, will be its knowledge workers and their productivity.
   Knowledge workers' productivity is the biggest of the 21st century
   management challenges. In the developed countries, it is their first
   survival requirement. Making knowledge workers productive requires
   changes in attitude, not only on the part of the individual knowledge
   worker but also on the part of the whole organization. (Drucker, 1999,
   in http://www.knowledgeworkerperformance.com).
   Creating knowledge relates to the education system, which creates
   knowledge workers and innovation system, for example soft skills (worker
   behaviour), Positive Psychological Capital (Luthan et. al, 2007), and
   hard skill such as ICT literacy. The innovation system, which
   contributes to innovativeness, in any country, consists of institutions,
   rules, and procedures that affect how the system acquires, creates,
   disseminates, and uses knowledge.
   The objectives of this research are to develop a conceptual model which
   describse the relationship among the soft skills of knowledge workers,
   hard skills of knowledge workers, innovativeness of knowledge workers in
   the context of knowledge economy in Indonesia as a developing country.
   Multiple Regression Analysis was used as a method for this research. The
   conceptual model was designed with independent and dependent variables.
   The independent variables are hard skills, information seeking hard
   skills, concept thinking soft skills, and self efficacy - positive
   psychological capital. The dependent variables are: technical
   innovativeness (product and services) and non-technical innovativeness
   (organization and marketing). Only one company as the subject of this
   research which becomes the limitation of the study. The research
   findings are that only information seeking soft skill that positively
   influnced technical innovativeness and only hard skills that positively
   influenced non-technical innovativeness. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The literature on technological change and regional development in
   latecomer countries has argued that foreign and domestic firms differ
   markedly with regard to their innovation and upgrading efforts. Foreign
   firms tend to possess greater initial technological capabilities and
   better access to advanced technologies, but often retain advanced
   production and innovation activities at their home bases. Some domestic
   firms, on the other hand, enter the market with fewer resources and
   lower technological capabilities, but make great efforts to learn. It
   thus remains a matter of debate as to whether foreign or domestic firms
   are contributing to the formation and upgrading of regional innovation
   systems in late-corner countries. This paper provides empirical evidence
   for the innovation activities of foreign and domestic Chinese firms by
   testing theoretically-based hypotheses with company survey data from 222
   electronics firms in the Pearl River Delta in South China. The major
   findings are that non-domestic firms carry out innovation activities
   with greater intensity and more external collaboration than domestic
   firms. The potential for the emergence of a more coherent regional
   innovation system and a technological catch-up to the standard of the
   non-domestic incumbents on the part of domestic electronics firms is
   rather limited.}},

   of all the districts is very similar, but the application of science and
   the role of local institutions explain the evolution of the cluster in

   Although endowed with better natural resources, the Italian districts
   belong to a very weak national innovation system and are now strongly

Abstract = {{Literature on the economics of science and technology (S\&T) suggests
   not only that technological innovation demands the expansion of the
   institutional borders between universities, research institutes,

   very dependent on scientific research, which represents a source of
   information that impels the productive sector. The latter introduces a
   series of questions that motivate the researchers in their attempt to
   understand how the human body reacts to certain products and therapies.
   This paper analyses the pattern of S\&T interaction for both the
   national system of innovation (NSI) and the health innovation system.
   The panel data and simultaneous equations models analyze the interaction
   between S\&T. The theory about the existence of a mutual dependence
   between them has been confirmed, which means that science moves
   technology and technology also influences scientific development. The
   estimated models, which use data from scientific papers and patents as
   proxies of science and technology, represent just the tip of the iceberg

Abstract = {{The bedrock of manufacturing, and in fact globalisation of production
   and marketing, is science and technology (S\&T). Some industrialised
   countries that are poorly endowed with natural resources have become
   affluent societies through the execution of sound manufacturing
   productions developed through the application of S\&T.
   Despite the various National Development Plans put in place in Nigeria
   to enhance industrialisation, the country still remains a mono-resource
   (crude oil) based economy. Growth in manufacturing is also in a
   downwards trend, and industrial capacity utilisation is below 37\%. The
   poor performance of the manufacturing sector has been attributed to a
   number of factors which include, amongst others: high cost of production
   due to high exchange rate, weak demand for manufactures due to declining
   purchasing power of the populace: high expenditure on spare parts,
   repairs/maintenance: legal and illegal influx of cheap imported goods
   (globalisation of trade); and political instability, especially during
   the military regimes.
   For the country to improve its manufacturing sector, evolve a
   manufacturing-based economy and be relevant in the globalisation of
   production and trade, it should pursue a combination of these S\&T
   approaches and moves: generation and application of S\&T knowledge
   relevant to manufacturing through in-country R\&D, S\&T and innovation
   efforts; technological licensing and transfer; encouragement of foreign
   direct investments: adoption of continuous improvements and innovation
   programmes; and technological knowledge initiation. This is only
   possible in a national innovation system with the following enabling

   the US, where an appropriate mix of economic choices, social regulation

   the development and commercialization of biotechnologies. Moreover, with
   the heightening competition in the global economy, state and firms of
   developed economies have evolved into a relationship of close
   partnership. This shows that, far from being irrelevant, the state
   remains a political entity that structures the innovation system in

Abstract = {{This paper aims at identifying some implications for the Korean ex-ante
   preparation of S and T integration. In particular, it focuses on the
   differences in the S and T systems between South and North Korea. There
   are some similarities between both systems. There is a strong tendency
   toward regional concentration of research capacities in a few regions.
   The public research sector is not functionally divided but some public
   research institutes carry out comprehensive R and D activities in
   respective areas. University research is poor in both countries.
   However, there are strong differences between the two systems. First,
   South Korean S and T policy has always been to enhance national
   competitiveness, while North Korean is to support the realization of the
   socialist revolution. Second, there are several ministries in South
   Korea that engage in R and D promotion, but there is no ministry-level
   organization for S and T policy in North Korea and the Labor Party's
   Office of Science and Technology is very influential in S and T policy.
   Third, there are about 25 government-sponsored research institutes under
   the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) in South Korea, while
   major R and D activities in North Korea are concentrated in four
   Academies and a research center. Fourth, South Korean universities have
   started to play an important role in the national innovation system, but
   North Korean universities have not shown any satisfactory R and D
   activities. Finally, South Korean industry is the most important actor
   in the national innovation system, while North Korean industry has had
   not much of any role in the national innovation system.
   This paper argues that these differences should be taken into account in
   the unification of the South and North Korean innovation systems. It
   expects that the South Korean system will be the frame of reference for
   the North Korean system in the unification process. In this sense, the
   current South Korean system needs to be significantly improved.
   Unification should be utilized as a valuable opportunity for formulating
   a competent, unified innovation system for Korea. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The historical contest of the Israeli defense industry is reviewed to
   identify the circumstances conducive to the emergence of R \& D networks
   through which major defense firms are pursuing defense conversion today.
   Technology policies, organizational strategies, and the
   institutionalization of a particular view of national security, have
   influenced the membership structures of these networks and allowed few
   rich firms rather than many industrial firms to gain access to an
   increased pool of advanced technological knowledge. The case of the
   largest defense firm in Israel is presented and the system of R \& D
   networks within the MAGNET Program is described. The paper argues that
   Israel needs an explicit diffusion-oriented policy for technology as
   well as open networks to involve relevant stakeholders in the country

   paper details policy conclusions and emphasizes the feasibility to learn
   through networks, the need to reemit government leadership, to formulate
   and implement a coordinated policy for the management of the national

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{190}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{285-297}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Within the Monocotyledons the anatomical ring-collapsing type of root
   contraction is very common. However, up to the present there has been no
   overall view of the anatomical changes and how they relate to the
   pulling and moving function of the root. The careful maceration of
   contractile roots of Arisarum vulgare makes it possible to measure the
   dimension of the cells, particularly the dimensional change during root
   contraction. It can be shown that the outer and middle cortical cells
   expand radially (increase in volume, growth) with simultaneous
   Longitudinal shortening, and finally collapse. The inner cortical cells
   of Arisarum show a longitudinal shortening which is synchronous to that
   of the outer and middle cortical cells. The inner cortical cells retain
   their original volume, which means that no cell growth occurs.
   Occasionally, expansion and shortening of the outer and middle cortical
   cells occur at different times. Then, first a radial expansion of the
   cells is seen, followed by their shortening.
   A consideration of the early results shown in Acidanthera seem to make
   it possible to suggest a unified anatomical model of root contraction.
   In this model, radial expansion and longitudinal shortening are two
   processes of activity of the cortical cells which, in principle, take
   place separately in time and space. Both activities are important for
   underground plant movement. Contrary to all earlier models it is assumed
   that the inner cortical cells shorten actively and thus produce a
   pulling force acting on the innovation system of the plant. This
   shortening activity can be limited to the inner cells (e. g.
   Acidanthera), but it may be that it also takes place in the middle, and
   even in the outer cortex (Arisarum). However, the main activity of the
   middle and outer cortex is the radial expansion which has nothing
   immediately to do with root shortening. Radial expansion develops a
   force which results in a sideward pushing of the soil (pushing force,
   work of expansion) and therefore makes movement in the soil easier
   (channel effect). The collapse of these cells promotes shortening
   passively.}},

Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{103-113}},

Abstract = {{Path-breaking innovations are increasingly developed and commercialized
   by networks of co-creating actors, called innovation ecosystems.
   Previous work in this area demonstrates that the `internal' alignment of
   actors is critical to value creation in the innovation ecosystem.
   However, the literature has largely overlooked that the success of an
   innovation ecosystem also depends on its `external' viability,
   determined by the broader sociotechnical environment. That is,
   path-breaking innovations inherently challenge the prevailing
   socio-technical regime in a domain (e.g., established rules, artifacts
   and habits) that tends to be resistant to change. Overcoming this
   resistance is a major challenge for ventures pioneering path-breaking
   innovations. The paper contributes to the literature on innovation
   ecosystems by explicitly considering the socio-technical viability of
   the innovation ecosystem around a path-breaking innovation. In
   particular, we theorize about the objects of manipulation in an
   innovation ecosystem and discuss the strategies that a focal venture,
   orchestrating the innovation ecosystem, can employ in manipulating these
   objects so as to increase the socio-technical viability of the
   ecosystem. We arrive at a multi-level perspective on innovation
   ecosystem development that integrates internal alignment and external
   viability and informs a research agenda for future studies in this
   field.}},

Abstract = {{We study the extent to which emerging market multinational enterprises

   and targeted weaker host NIS to limit the cognitive gap EMNEs would need
   to address. Instead, more recent acquisitions by EMNEs are supported by
   a stronger home NIS, and target firms in stronger host NIS. We also
   propose that acquisitions by high-tech (versus non-high-tech) EMNEs need
   a stronger home NIS due to the technological complexity of the industry,

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1013-1034}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The aim of this paper is to frame the stakeholder-driven
   system mapping approach in the context of climate change, building on
   stakeholder knowledge of system boundaries, key elements and
   interactions within a system and to introduce a decision support tool
   for managing and visualising this knowledge into insightful system maps
   with policy implications.
   Design/methodology/approach - This methodological framework is based on
   the concepts of market maps. The process of eliciting and visualising
   expert knowledge is facilitated by means of a reference implementation
   in MATLAB, which allows for designing technological innovation systems
   models in either a structured or a visual format.
   Findings - System mapping can contribute to evaluating systems for
   climate change by capturing knowledge of expert groups with regard to
   the dynamic interrelations between climate policy strategies and other
   system components, which may promote or hinder the desired transition to
   low carbon societies.
   Research limitations/implications - This study explores how system
   mapping addresses gaps in analytical tools and complements the systems
   of innovation framework. Knowledge elicitation, however, must be
   facilitated and build upon a structured framework such as technological
   innovation systems.
   Practical implications - This approach can provide policymakers with
   significant insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current policy
   frameworks based on tacit knowledge embedded in stakeholders.
   Social implications - The developed methodological framework aims to
   include societal groups in the climate policy-making process by
   acknowledging stakeholders' role in developing transition pathways. The
   system map codifies stakeholder input in a structured and transparent
   manner.
   Originality/value - This is the first study that clearly defines the
   system mapping approach in the frame of climate policy and introduces
   the first dedicated software option for researchers and decision makers
   to use for implementing this methodology.}},

Abstract = {{In a new knowledge-intensive economic landscape, firms need to access
   external knowledge sources due to their inability to generate all

   This network of linkages can be considered as an ecosystem in which
   commercial enterprises and non-firm organizations interact with one
   another and work together to create and capture value. Previous studies
   have shown that a firm's ability to successfully commercialize a new
   product depends not only on its own technology strategy but also its
   capabilities to manage an innovation ecosystem strategy. Dynamic
   markets, intense competition, and shorter product lifecycles force
   companies across different industries to create and capture value more
   rapidly by launching new innovations. Well-defined and executed
   innovation ecosystem strategies can help companies to develop new
   markets and business opportunities for the different types of
   innovations and enable their businesses to grow. This study provides new
   insight into how an ecosystem strategy can be formed based on the

   keywords. The keywords relate to the thematic clusters of renewable
   energy technologies, energy efficiency, and environmental management.
   The priorities of the countries in each main interaction of the system
   are classified accordingly. The priorities are compared to the existing
   level of specialization in the keywords based on the intermediate
   outputs of the system. The analyses cover 153,838 papers and 15,138
   patents between the years 2003 and 2014. A Sustainable Innovation Index
   is developed to aggregate the normalized values of country performance
   across all keywords. Singapore receives the highest value (21.17) and
   the average of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa is 14.91.
   The results determine the ability of countries to align priorities and
   performance towards more mature innovation systems for sustainable
   development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{European financial crisis has raised questions about the sustainability
   and the contribution of innovation anchors especially in Southern
   European countries such as Greece. This paper utilizes the concept of
   regional innovation systems (RISs) and introduces a methodological
   approach that allows for evaluating an Science and Technology Park's
   (STP) contribution into the corresponding RIS performance, taking into
   consideration (1) the RIS idiosyncrasies, (2) the dominant role of
   government expenditures on R\&D and (3) the underlying complexity of
   knowledge production and management, under alternative sets of
   restrictions imposed by fiscal consolidation on the preferences of
   authorities which design and implement Science, Technology and
   Innovation (STI) policies. Our framework relies on the estimation of a
   multi-input-multi-output latent knowledge production function approach
   and the corresponding efficiency indices. Data requirements are sourced
   from the Regional Innovation Scoreboard, for the four Greek regions and
   from a small-scale case study, with respect to the examined regional STP
   covering the period from 2000 to 2012. The main empirical findings
   highlight that the contribution of the examined STP in the corresponding
   RIS performance diminishes alongside with the decrease in GERD
   investment levels, with respect to all the efficiency indices. These
   findings are attributed to the structural characteristics of both the
   RIS and the STP under investigation, and capture their dependence on
   managing public financial resources for STI activities.}},

Title = {{Drivers for the Adoption of Eco-Innovations in the German Fertilizer
   Supply Chain}},
Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Use of fertilizers has enabled a massive increase in crop production
   yields. However, this has come with severe negative externalities (e.g.,
   greenhouse gas emission; eutrophication of non-agricultural ecosystems).
   Eco-innovations are one option to reduce the environmental impact of
   fertilizers without compromising fertilizer productivity. Although
   numerous eco-innovations in the domain of fertilizers are available,
   they have not yet seen a sufficient adoption rate. In this paper we
   explore main drivers for adoption of eco-innovations in the German
   fertilizer supply chain based on empirical investigations at three
   levels of the fertilizer supply chain: producers, traders, and farmers.
   We strive to take a ``chain perspective{''} on environmental concerns
   and knowledge of fertilizer specific eco-innovations. The study was
   carried out in two steps: initially we conducted exploratory expert
   interviews with eight actors of the fertilizer supply chain. The
   statements generated thereby fed into a questionnaire answered by 57
   participants stemming from fertilizer production (n = 12), traders (n =
   34) and farmers (n = 11) level. Findings suggest that drivers for
   eco-innovations are perceived differently by the various actors in the
   fertilizer supply chain. Overall knowledge on eco-innovations decreases
   downstream the chain. By taking a chain perspective on the adoption of
   eco-innovation, our paper contributes to the emerging body of literature
   on drivers for eco-innovation, and also maps out managerial implications
   of fostering the implementation of eco-innovations in the fertilizer
   supply chain.}},

Abstract = {{To mitigate climate change, substantial investments are needed in

   Biomass gasification needs to take the step from public to private

   high risk. Mobilising the amount of capital needed to bring about
   large-scale diffusion of offshore wind power will require innovative
   financial solutions. To overcome these challenges, changes are needed in

Abstract = {{Recently, innovation has become a critical parameter for contemporary

   African debates about regional and local development policy issues of

   intended to inform the DST's involvement in the policy space of LED with
   the mandate of strengthening local systems of innovation and production
   in a systemic and systematic manner. It is argued that in terms of LED

Abstract = {{Purpose: Little is known about effective ways to operationalize
   agricultural innovation processes. We use the MasAgro program in Mexico
   (which aims to increase maize and wheat productivity, profitability and
   sustainability), and the experiences of middle level `hub managers', to
   understand how innovation processes occur in heterogeneous and changing
   contexts. Design/methodology/approach: We use a comparative case study
   analysis involving research tools such as documentary review, key
   informant interviews, focus group discussions, and reflection workshops
   with key actors. Findings: Our research shows how a program, that
   initially had a relatively narrow technology focus, evolved towards an
   innovation system approach. The adaptive management of such a process
   was in response to context-specific challenges and opportunities. In the
   heterogeneous context of Mexico this results in diverse ways of
   operationalization at the hub level, leading to different collaborating
   partners and technology portfolios. Practical implications: MasAgro
   experiences merit analysis in the light of national public efforts to
   transform agricultural advisory services and accommodate pluralistic
   agricultural extension approaches in Latin America. Such efforts need
   long-term coherent macro level visions, frameworks and support, while
   the serendipitous nature of the process requires meso-level implementers
   to respond and adapt to and move the innovation process forward.
   Originality/value: This paper contributes to the debate on how to
   operationalize large programs by showing that the innovation support
   arrangements enacted in the field should allow for diversity and have a
   degree of flexibility to accommodate heterogeneous demands from farmers
   in different contexts as well as continuous changes in the

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{424-442}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of the
   interface organizations of a regional innovation system on the dynamics
   of knowledge transfer between universities and firms.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Triple Helix approach is used as a
   heuristic tool. The paper is based on a face-to-face survey to a sample
   of 800 innovative firms in Andalusia (Spain). The analysis focusses on
   the effectiveness attributed by the firms to technology transfer offices
   (TTOs), science parks and the regional innovation agency.
   Findings - Different organizations have different roles in the
   relationships that firms maintain with universities in a regional
   innovation system. Firm's positive perceptions of TTOs, science parks
   and the innovation agency in the promotion of knowledge transfer are
   associated to the kind of relationships maintained with universities.
   Research limitations/implications - The research focusses on the region
   of Andalusia. Further studies could consider the applicability of the
   findings in other regional innovation systems.
   Practical implications - The paper helps governments and managers of
   TTOs, science parks and innovation agencies to understand the real use
   that interface organizations have for the industrial tissue of a
   regional innovation system.
   Originality/value - There have been few studies that observe together
   the value attributed by firms to the several interface organizations in
   a specific innovation system. The analysis contributes to the debate on
   the adjustment of the different roles of interface organizations in the
   promotion of knowledge transfer and innovation dynamics.}},

   this context, we examined monitoring data from an Adaptive Research (AR)

   to capture the improvisational capacities of farmers and to reveal
   social and institutional constraints and opportunities in a broader

   farmers adjusted their practices and how actors involved linked (or not)
   with others in the innovation system. We also demonstrated how
   institutions such as policies, religious rituals or service provider
   arrangements pose conditions that establish or constrain practices
   aligned with introduced technologies. A broader perspective in
   monitoring AR therefore provides important additional insights into the
   factors which shape outcomes in farming communities. To expand outcomes,

Abstract = {{Accelerating the international use of climate mitigation technologies is
   key if efforts to curb climate change are to succeed, especially in
   developing countries, where weak domestic technological innovation
   systems constrain the uptake of climate change mitigation technologies.
   Several intergovernmental agencies have set up specific programmes to
   support the diffusion of climate mitigation technologies. Using a
   simplified technological innovation system-based framework, this paper
   aims to systematically review these programmes, with the dual aim of
   assessing their collective success in promoting technological
   innovation, and identifying opportunities for the newly formed UNFCCC
   Technology Mechanism. We conclude that, while all programmes reviewed
   have promoted technology transfer, they have given limited attention to
   innovation capabilities with users, government and universities.
   Functions that could be further developed include knowledge development,

Abstract = {{Innovation is the transformation of knowledge of any kind into new
   products or services in the market. Its importance as a production
   factor is widely acknowledged. In the age of the knowledge-based economy
   innovation became critical for any company or even country to compete
   globally. Many countries are encouraging innovation through various
   mechanisms, and one of the most widely used is the provision of special
   incentives for innovation. This paper investigates incentive systems for
   the growth of technology companies as a strategy to promote
   knowledge-based economic development. As for the case investigations the
   study focuses on an emerging economy, Brazil. The research is based upon
   the available literature, best practices, government policy and review
   of incentive systems. The findings provide insights from the case study
   in a country context and some lessons learned for other countries using
   incentive systems to boost the innovation capabilities of their

   HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{201-206}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Health Technology Assessment (HTA) needs to address the
   challenges posed by high cost, effective technologies, expedited
   regulatory approaches, and the opportunities provided by collaborative
   real-world evaluation of technologies. The Health Technology Assessment
   International (HTAi) Policy Forum met to consider these issues and the
   implications for evidence production to inform HTA. This paper shares
   their discussion to stimulate further debate.
   Methods: A background paper, presentations, group discussions, and
   stakeholder role play at the 2015 HTAi Policy Forum meeting informed
   this paper.
   Results: HTA has an important role to play in helping improve evidence
   production and ensuring that the health service is ready to adopt
   effective technologies. It needs to move from simply informing health
   system decisions to also working actively to align stakeholder
   expectations about realistic evidence requirements. Processes to support
   dialogue over the health technology life cycle need to be developed that
   are mindful of limited resources, operate across jurisdictions and learn
   from past processes. Collaborations between health technology developers
   and health systems in different countries should be encouraged to
   develop evidence that will inform decision making. New analytical
   techniques emerging for real-world data should be harnessed to support
   modeling for HTA.
   Conclusions: A paradigm shift (to Health Innovation System 2.0) is
   suggested where HTA adopts a more central, proactive role to support
   alignment within and amongst stakeholders over the whole life cycle of
   the technology. This could help ensure that evidence production is
   better aligned with patient and health system needs and so is more
   effective and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{``Innovationsprozesse empirisch erfassen. Ein Pladoyer fur die
   Erweiterung des Methodenspektrums{''}. During the past decades,
   innovation research has yielded countless empirical studies in a variety
   of disciplines. For all this quantity, we still lack an adequate
   understanding of basic qualities and mechanisms of its central subject.
   Which processes and conditions bring innovation about? How does it
   spread? And what is its genuine nature? Critics argue that these
   shortcomings have their roots in the conceptual limitations of
   established perspectives on innovation and in the fact that researchers
   confine themselves to studying technical and scientific novelties or
   marketable products. This self-restriction stands in marked contrast to
   the observation that innovation plays an important role in contemporary
   societies. The term is at least ubiquitous and its usage common in all
   societal fields. In the introduction to this HSR Special Issue, we
   subscribe to this critique and argue that the conceptual reductionism
   comes along with severe methodical and methodological limitations. These
   become manifest in a joint dominance of quantitative indicator-based
   research and ethnographic single case studies. Thus, researchers of
   innovation disregard a variety of possible data types and forms of
   analysis and rarely apply complex designs. It is also not common to
   consider the combination of multiple types of data and analysis in mixed
   methods approaches. The most serious issue, however, is that mainstream
   innovation research remains ignorant of a multitude of potential
   research questions and thereby loses sight of whole areas of interest.
   An overview of the empirical studies in this HSR Special Issue shows
   that the range of methods used is wider at the edges of the field of
   research. In order to relate these methods to each other and to the
   theoretical foundations of innovation research, we suggest a
   middle-range debate on methodology.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes innovation activities in the marine energy sector
   across ten European countries in 2011. Intense knowledge creation
   occurred in the UK and northern European countries, while European
   research networks encouraged public-private partnerships facilitating
   knowledge diffusion. An analysis based on a technological innovation
   system (TIS) has identified challenges for the system to evolve from one
   phase of development to another, i.e. from pre-development to take-off
   phase. In order for marine energy to pass successfully through the
   commercialisation `valley of death', entrepreneurial experimentation and
   production is crucial. Entrepreneurial initiatives were developed mainly
   in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway and Ireland, whereas France,
   Germany and Sweden were active through venture capital initiatives.
   Additional system-builders, such as the authorities in charge of energy
   policies, could offer guidance for research, ensure legitimacy and
   effectively mobilise resources for system development. Although public
   support was efficient in stimulating private investment, national
   targets seemed less efficient in creating a long time horizon for
   private investors, due to consecutive, unexpected changes. In contrast,
   positive interactions between technology developers and policy-makers
   could empower market formation. Ultimately, the creation of a policy
   community, also involving local communities, could foster a positive
   environment for the development of innovation activities. (C) 2014 The

   important institutional and policy changes, which transform the

   encouraging A-I collaborations, have enabled domestic research
   institutes to influence the acquisition, creation, and diffusion of
   knowledge in the innovation network. Nonetheless, the country continues
   to struggle in commercializing domestic scientific research to step into
   a knowledge-based economy. Therefore, this paper suggests that more

Abstract = {{The paper adds to the existing literature on the determinants of
   government spending in Research and Development (R\&D) by considering
   the role of strategic interactions among countries as one of the
   possible competing explanations, within a spatial econometric framework.
   We account for several factors affecting national levels of public R\&D
   spending, including (i) the international context - i.e. Lisbon
   strategy; (ii) country characteristics - level of private R\&D, GDP,
   trade openness and the National System of Innovation; (iii) countries'
   similarities in relation to (a) trade and economic size and (b) sectoral
   specialization. The analysis is carried out on 14 European countries.
   First, we find that factors traditionally affecting the level of public
   R\&D expenditure, such as the scale of the national economy, trade
   openness, sectoral specialization and private R\&D, significantly
   influence the level of public R\&D in European countries between 1994
   and 2006. Interestingly, the introduction of the Lisbon strategy does
   not seem to have affected changes in the levels of public R\&D spending.
   Second, by using different weight matrices, we confirm the existence of
   strategic interactions in relation to R\&D spending among European
   countries with similar economic, international trade and sectoral
   structure characteristics, though not geographically close. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Partnerships have recently gained increasing popularity in the
   development community and are thought to play a key role in facilitating
   market access for smallholder farmers. This is particularly evident in
   South Africa, where strategic partnerships between emerging farmers and
   agribusinesses have become important instruments by which the government
   may promote the transition of `emerging farmers' into independent
   commercial farmers able to participate in global markets. This article
   studies six partnerships in the South African citrus sector to analyse
   to what extent they enhance the `commercialisation' of emerging farmers.
   An `innovation system' perspective is applied to understand how far
   partnerships actually challenge and change the status of emerging
   farmers. Our results indicate that partnerships succeed in increasing
   market access. A closer look at the partnership processes, however,
   reveals the conditions under which success is achieved and that
   partnerships may be less instrumental in helping emerging farmers become
   independent entrepreneurs. Thus, a partnership model characterised by
   export orientation and knowledge transfer from agribusinesses to
   emerging farmers is limited in its transformative potential, calling for
   policy-makers to move beyond a pragmatic approach to partnerships.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we reflect on how patents of introduction or
   importation, which compose an institutional policy related to weak IPR
   systems, could influence long-term international technology transfer.
   Both theoretically and empirically, the consequences of strengthening
   IPRs in lagging economies for technology transfer and innovation remain
   unclear. Although the mainstream literature tends to link stronger
   patent enforcement with better invention and innovation markets now and
   in the past, new theoretical and historical evidence supports extreme
   complexity in the relationship between IPR extension and scope and
   technological diffusion. For the first time, in this study, we analyze a
   large series of patents of introduction, which were a common feature of
   the early stages of almost all patent systems designed to favor
   technology transfer and innovation above original inventor property
   rights. Though typically used by pioneers, followers, and latecomers, we
   know little of how they functioned and their consequences. In this
   study, we analyze the use of patents of introduction throughout the
   nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Spain, which was a lagging country
   on the European periphery. The results demonstrate that this
   institutional policy could facilitate technology transfer, innovation,
   and advancement at earlier stages of industrialization. As additional
   research has demonstrated, such evidence may have serious implications
   for IPR treatment in both developing and underdeveloped economies.}},

Pages = {{1189-1208}},

Abstract = {{The US national innovation system has a dual structure: part suited to
   rapid innovation, and part stubbornly resistant to change. The complex,
   established Legacy sectors' that resist change, particularly disruptive
   innovation, share common features that obstruct the market launch of
   innovations, over and above the valley of death' and other obstacles
   that have been the traditional focus of innovation policy. Innovations
   in Legacy sectors must penetrate a well-established and well-defended
   technological/economic/political/social paradigm that favours existing
   technology, characterised by (1) perverse' subsidies and price
   structures that create a mismatch between the incentives of producers
   and broader social goals, such as environmental sustainability, public
   health and safety, and geopolitical security; (2) established
   infrastructure and institutional architecture that imposes regulatory
   hurdles or other disadvantages to new entrants (3) market imperfections
   beyond those faced by other innovations: network economies, lumpiness,
   economies of scale, split incentives, needs for collective action, and
   transaction costs (4) politically powerful vested interests, reinforced
   by public support, that defend the paradigm and resist innovations that
   threaten their business models (5) public habits and expectations
   attuned to existing technology and (6) an established knowledge and
   human resources structure adapted to its needs. Beyond these obstacles,
   more socially desirable technologies that are driven by environmental or
   other non-market considerations must overcome the lack of agreed
   replacement standards against which putative alternatives can be judged.
   We have developed a new, integrative analytic framework for categorising
   the obstacles to market launch faced by Legacy sectors, and earlier
   applied this method to energy, health delivery, the long-distance
   electric grid, building, and air transport. In energy especially, the
   requirement for innovation is sufficiently urgent that large-scale
   domestic and collaborative international research should take place even
   at the cost of possible competitive disadvantage and even if it is some
   time before the USA adopts carbon charges and thereby puts pressure on
   the prevailing paradigm of fossil fuel use. We now extend this method to
   sustainable agriculture. American paradigms in agriculture and in energy
   are exported worldwide, delaying the development and spread of needed
   innovations that are not consistent with them. Foreign manufacturers
   wishing to enter US markets must suit their products in these sectors to
   American paradigms, while American exports of technology may be
   insufficiently cost conscious or respectful of environmental
   sustainability. Developing countries are technology takers and suffer
   from asymmetric innovative capability. They need to choose sources of
   technology best suited to their situation. India and China constitute
   new competitive threats, but also represent innovative developing
   countries' that have large domestic markets in which they are launching
   innovations aimed at their lower income populations.}},

   strengthen the role of intermediaries in developing countries,
   governments should pay attention to the issue of the division of labour

   intermediaries should play an active role in producing public goods
   necessary for the technological upgrading of firms in the sector while
   private intermediaries should play active roles in industry and/or firm

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the role of equity financing to support
   entrepreneurship in Asia with a particular focus on venture capital (VC)
   financing policies of Singapore and Thailand. Although Singapore and
   Thailand adopt the government intervention approach in VC financing, the

   use of innovation financing policies in the catch-up process to develop
   its economy and strong network linkages with US Silicon Valley. The case
   of Thailand has shown poor network linkages with redundant
   organizations/agencies competing on offering similar innovation
   financing schemes. The study offers effective innovation financing

Abstract = {{Purpose - Institutional voids the lack of institutions that can
   facilitate the functioning of markets are ubiquitous in emerging
   markets. Because of their newness, entrepreneurial ventures are
   especially susceptible to institutional vacuums. This research seeks to
   shed light on the role that business groups can play in the development
   of entrepreneurial ventures in emerging markets.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on detailed fieldwork, the study
   describes and analyzes the creation and evolution of two biotechnology
   start-ups that were affiliated to a major Latin American business group.
   The research covers the period between their foundation and later
   acquisition by a multinational company.
   Findings - The article discusses the role that the business group
   affiliation had in terms of helping the start-ups to interact with
   multiple institutional voids. The analysis shows that the start-ups
   benefited from the group's reputation and connections, experience and
   know-how in managing different types of businesses in the country;
   strong resource base, long-term vision, and strong organizational
   culture.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this work is to show that
   business group affiliation can be an interesting solution that
   facilitates the development of entrepreneurial ventures in emerging
   markets.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the only technology available to

   Two countries' current cooperation on CCS through Clean Energy Research

   Cooperation mechanism provides an important initial step towards even
   closer and stronger cooperation in the future. In this paper, we justify
   such possibility by discourse on the seemly different but complementary
   social-political context in two countries including political system,
   government structure, economic policy, national innovation system,
   energy strategy, and energy market structure. We further address the key
   elements of future cooperation model by carefully considering the
   principle of equality and mutual beneficiary, the role of two countries
   in the whole value chain according to their comparative advantages, and
   the scale and mechanism of the funding. A milestone for the cooperation
   until 2030 is drafted and priority areas for both countries in the

Abstract = {{It is commonly believed that the academic sector does not generate
   enough value for society. This value is often measured in terms of new
   firms, patents and products, leading to policy responses which aim to

   academic research generates benefits in many ways, some of which are
   difficult to measure, and that policy must look beyond the academic
   sector to find ways of improving the impact of academic R\&D. Applying a
   new version of the `technological innovation system' framework to
   nanotechnology in Sweden, we find a rich pattern of impact, including
   substantial `commercialisation'. However, the effect of academic
   activities is constrained by factors exogenous to academia, in
   particular a lack of knowledge about environmental and health risks,
   institutional and market uncertainties, poorly coordinated policies and
   insufficient access to innovation-related capital. Policy-makers seeking

Abstract = {{In India, as in most developing countries, biotechnology was ushered in
   through public policy rather than individual firm initiatives.
   Throughout the 1980s and until the mid-1990s the focus of public policy
   was on creation of scientific capabilities and building of awareness of
   the potential of biotechnology. With the adoption of economic
   liberalization in the 19905, the Indian State also began to sponsor
   private initiatives in capacity building. Today, the leading Indian
   firms have commercialized generic versions of original innovations
   developed by US and Japanese firms, using the traditional route of
   re-engineering. A handful of firms are actively engaged in first order
   innovation and in addition, a number of start-ups have emerged to make
   use of opportunities to provide contract research services to Western
   and Japanese multinationals. But can a focus on bio-generics and
   contracting for multinationals be used as a route for competence
   building and as a stepping stone to become original innovators? The
   present article shows that while India has `strong scientific and
   technological capabilities', it is constrained by weak `social
   capabilities' of its labor force, lack of `institutional capabilities'
   in regulation and financing, infrastructural constraints and absence of
   national programs to achieve concrete targets in terms of biotechnology
   innovations to promote a more inclusive development. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Pages = {{1785-1801}},
Abstract = {{The concept of territorial knowledge dynamics (TKDs) has been introduced
   as an update to existing territorial innovation models (TIMs),
   questioning the focus of TIMs on technological innovation, as well as
   the traditional distinction between production and consumption. This
   paper considers whether the TKD concept can ``make a difference{''}
   compared to traditional TIMs, in general, and, in particular, in
   relation to public policy played out at the regional level. This paper
   identifies three elements highlighted in the TKD concept, which have
   been introduced as additions to the literature on TIMs. These involve
   the necessity of acquiring a combination of different types of knowledge
   in innovation processes, establishing external relations and taking into
   consideration the complexity of producer and consumer relations. This
   paper analyses the role which has been assigned to the administrative
   region within the framework of three selected TIMs, the regional
   innovation system, clusters and the learning region, and the way in
   which policy has been implemented in regions in ways that relate to the
   three elements highlighted in the TKD concept. This paper suggests that
   the main way in which the TKD concept adds to existing TIMs is with its
   focus on active regional outreach, in establishing external relations
   and supporting producer-consumer relations. The TKD approach could be
   seen as a new ``intermediate synthesis{''} in the ongoing process of the
   TIM concept development, much like the learning regions a decade
   earlier.}},

Abstract = {{The situation in which a multinational firm compensates for comparative

Abstract = {{There has been a recent trend among policymakers to consider the science
   park as a knowledge-based economic development strategy-one that
   encourages and supports the start-up and development of innovation-led
   industry. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the South Korean
   technopark. Technoparks on average had a higher number of tenants,
   tenant employees, and tenant firm sales compared to those of the other
   business incubators in Korea. Although the survival rate was relatively
   high in technoparks compared to that of the other business incubators,
   some of the technoparks were not effective at encouraging tenants to
   graduate from the incubator in a timely manner. The support program
   provided by the technopark format enables firms to easily access
   innovation resources and to reduce the costs of doing business. The
   incubator reduces the operating costs of tenant firms by providing
   facilities and shared services at low cost as well as aiding in market
   expansion. Moreover, the incubator provides tenant firms with research
   and development support, which results in the enhancement of innovation
   capability. Nonetheless, the strategies of the technopark and local
   government have not been sufficiently thorough in encouraging the
   incubated firms to settle in the same jurisdiction, in order to promote
   regional economic growth and to stimulate a continuous regional
   innovation system. We explored the organizational performance of the
   technopark and ascertained the relationship between the organizational
   effectiveness and the performance outcome. Local government and the

Abstract = {{The article investigates how agricultural extension services respond to
   demands for new knowledge support within agriculture. The author asks
   whether they provide for the knowledge needs of agriculture as per a
   conventional agro-industrial model, or act as catalysts for
   restructuring processes. The extension services are analysed as part of
   regional innovation systems. The article investigates extension services
   in one Norwegian county, Hedmark, and one Swedish county, Varmland. In
   Varmland changes are aimed towards a regionally networked system
   supporting entrepreneurship and rural development. In Hedmark the
   extension services remain integrated in a regionalized national
   innovation system promoting a conventional agro-industrial model,
   although signs of support of an extended knowledge base are identified.}},

Abstract = {{We aim to study the innovation process in medical technology from an
   evolutionary perspective. By considering a case of medical imaging
   technology in Europe and in Japan for over a decade, our empirical
   investigation shows that medical organizations clinically evaluate
   technological alternatives, from which emerge clinical innovations not
   captured in patents and licenses and more importantly diffused among a
   larger community of practice, beyond geographic boundaries. These
   findings direct our attention to propose a model that links
   technological change and lead users within a microstate innovation
   system with respect to clinical advances for patients. This model uses a
   dynamic and interpretative approach that allows variation and selection
   within and among heterogeneous agents for technological change. In turn,
   the clinical innovation system provides us with insights into how firms
   potentially benefit from these localized interactions through a
   transnational collaborative and collective learning process. This
   captures the unique and distinct knowledge accumulated by lead users for
   novel solutions, which is beyond sole product development.}},

Abstract = {{Along with increasing significance of innovation in socio-economic
   development grows the need to utilize future-oriented knowledge in
   innovation policy-making. Foresight and road-map exercises are aimed at
   supporting planning and priority-setting of R\&D and have become
   indispensable elements of policy-making. Besides technological
   development decision-makers need all-inclusive knowledge of future
   developments of society. economy and impacts of science and technology.
   When the worldwide competition is about the attractiveness of innovation
   systems, such knowledge is important for comparing the innovation
   performance of nations to other economies. Finland is among the
   countries improving her position in worldwide performance comparisons
   since the late 1990s and reached leading nations in early 2000s. This
   attainment raised national interest and critical debate of the
   reliability of the data basis and methodologies used in comparisons. In
   The Finnish Association of Graduate Engineers (TEK) this discussion led
   to a decision to develop an own comparative exercise together with VTT.
   in addition to performance analysis based on ex-post indicators the
   barometer includes the questionnaire of the views and visions of the
   future development by relevant national actors. The theoretical
   framework of the barometer is based on the evolution of economies from
   industrial development phase to sustainable knowledge society. The
   barometer has been undertaken in 2004, 2005 and 2007, and a wide
   interest and emerged discussion of barometer proves that a social
   interest and order exists for the barometer. The article presents the
   background. methodology and results of technology barometer. discusses
   its impacts on national discussion, and gives perspectives for the
   future development of barometer. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this contribution is to examine the evolutionary
   transformations that have characterised the UK defence innovation system
   since the mid 1980s. It focuses on the central and challenging issue
   faced by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in implementing effective
   governance mechanisms emerging from the continuous trade-off between
   short-term market driven measures motivated by efficiency arguments, and
   more long term and relational considerations in terms of knowledge
   economics. Furthermore, in terms of technology transfer, this evolution
   has been accompanied by a gradual shift from an initial logic of
   spin-off to society expected from government driven military projects,
   to a logic of spin-in where the main concern of the military sector is
   to broaden its industrial and R\&D base.}},
